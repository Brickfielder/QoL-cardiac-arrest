wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The effect of sodium thiosulfate on immune cell metabolism during porcine hemorrhage and resuscitation,"Introduction: Sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), an H2S releasing agent, was shown to be organ-protective in experimental hemorrhage. Systemic inflammation activates immune cells, which in turn show cell type-specific metabolic plasticity with modifications of mitochondrial respiratory activity. Since H2S can dose-dependently stimulate or inhibit mitochondrial respiration, we investigated the effect of Na2S2O3 on immune cell metabolism in a blinded, randomized, controlled, long-term, porcine model of hemorrhage and resuscitation. For this purpose, we developed a Bayesian sampling-based model for C-13 isotope metabolic flux analysis (MFA) utilizing 1,2-C-13(2)-labeled glucose, C-13(6)-labeled glucose, and C-13(5)-labeled glutamine tracers.Methods: After 3 h of hemorrhage, anesthetized and surgically instrumented swine underwent resuscitation up to a maximum of 68 h. At 2 h of shock, animals randomly received vehicle or Na2S2O3 (25 mg/kg/h for 2 h, thereafter 100 mg/kg/h until 24 h after shock). At three time points (prior to shock, 24 h post shock and 64 h post shock) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and granulocytes were isolated from whole blood, and cells were investigated regarding mitochondrial oxygen consumption (high resolution respirometry), reactive oxygen species production (electron spin resonance) and fluxes within the metabolic network (stable isotope-based MFA).Results: PBMCs showed significantly higher mitochondrial O-2 uptake and lower O-2(center dot-) production in comparison to granulocytes. We found that in response to Na2S2O3 administration, PBMCs but not granulocytes had an increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption combined with a transient reduction of the citrate synthase flux and an increase of acetyl-CoA channeled into other compartments, e.g., for lipid biogenesis.Conclusion: In a porcine model of hemorrhage and resuscitation, Na2S2O3 administration led to increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption combined with stimulation of lipid biogenesis in PBMCs. In contrast, granulocytes remained unaffected. Granulocytes, on the other hand, remained unaffected. O-2(center dot-) concentration in whole blood remained constant during shock and resuscitation, indicating a sufficient anti-oxidative capacity. Overall, our MFA model seems to be is a promising approach for investigating immunometabolism; especially when combined with complementary methods.",FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY,2023,"Wolfschmitt, EM; Hogg, M; Vogt, JA; Zink, F; Wachter, U; Hezel, F; Zhang, XM; Hoffmann, A; Gröger, M; Hartmann, C; Gässler, H; Datzmann, T; Merz, T; Hellmann, A; Kranz, C; Calzia, E; Radermacher, P; Messerer, DAC",10.3389/fimmu.2023.1125594,,WOS:000946223400001,A

Further, we review the principles of exercise prescription for patients with known or suspected CVD, with specific reference to exercise modalities, contemporary guidelines, the minimum exercise training intensity to promote survival benefits, and long-term goal training intensities, based on age-, sex-, and fitness-adjusted targets. Finally, we provide practical ""prescription pearls"" for the clinician, including a simple rule to estimate metabolic equivalents (METs) during level and graded treadmill walking, research-based exercise training recommendations, using steps per day, MET-minutes per week, and personal activity intelligence to achieve beneficial treatment outcomes, as well as the heart rate index equation to estimate energy expenditure, expressed as METs, during recreational and leisure-time PA. Summary: This review compares moderate-intensity continuous training and high-intensity interval training, examines the role of PA and CRF in managing heart failure, and discusses the cardiovascular risks associated with extreme endurance exercise. It also provides practical guidelines for exercise prescription tailored to patients with CVD, highlighting advanced exercise prescription strategies to optimize cardiovascular health. Key Messages: Physicians and healthcare providers should prioritize referring patients to home-based or medically supervised exercise programs to leverage the cardioprotective benefits of regular PA. For most inactive patients, an exercise prescription is essential for improving overall health.",PULSE,2024,"Franklin, BA; Jae, SY",10.1159/000541166,,WOS:001377339000001,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Prolonged Deficits in Parvalbumin Neuron Stimulation-Evoked Network Activity Despite Recovery of Dendritic Structure and Excitability in the Somatosensory Cortex following Global Ischemia in Mice,"Relatively few studies have examined plasticity of inhibitory neuronal networks following stroke in vivo, primarily due to the inability to selectively monitor inhibition. We assessed the structure of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons during a 5 min period of global ischemia and reperfusion in mice, which mimicked cerebral ischemia during cardiac arrest or forms of transient ischemic attack. The dendritic structure of PV-neurons in cortical superficial layers was rapidly swollen and beaded during global ischemia, but recovered within 5-10 min following reperfusion. Using optogenetics and a multichannel optrode, we investigated the function of PV-neurons in mouse forelimb somatosensory cortex. We demonstrated pharmacologically that PV-channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) stimulation evoked activation in layer IV/V, which resulted in rapid current sinks mediated by photocurrent and action potentials (a measure of PV-neuron excitability), which was then followed by current sources mediated by network GABAergic synaptic activity. During ischemic depolarization, the PV-ChR2-evoked current sinks (excitability) were suppressed, but recovered rapidly following reperfusion concurrent with repolarization of the DC-EEG. In contrast, the current sources reflecting GABAergic synaptic network activity recovered slowly and incompletely, and was coincident with the partial recovery of the forepaw stimulation-evoked current sinks in layer IV/V 30 min post reperfusion. Our in vivo data suggest that the excitability of PV inhibitory neurons was suppressed during global ischemia and rapidly recovered during reperfusion. In contrast, PV-ChR2 stimulation-evoked GABAergic synaptic network activity exhibited a prolonged suppression even similar to 1 h after reperfusion, which could contribute to the dysfunction of sensation and cognition following transient global ischemia.",JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE,2014,"Xie, YC; Chen, SB; Wu, YJ; Murphy, TH",10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1775-14.2014,,WOS:000345220300009,A

This article presents a series of five patients with restraint-associated cardiac arrest and profound metabolic acidosis. The lowest recorded pH was 6.25; this patient and three others died despite aggressive resuscitation. The survivor's pH was 6.46; this patient subsequently made a good recovery. Struggling against restraints may produce a lactic acidosis. Stimulant drugs such as cocaine may promote further metabolic acidosis and impair normal behavioral regulatory responses. Restrictive positioning of combative patients may impede appropriate respiratory compensation for this acidemia. Public safety personnel and emergency providers must be aware of the life threat to combative patients and be careful with restraint techniques. Further investigation of sedative agents and buffering therapy for this select patient group is suggested.,ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,1999,"Hick, JL; Smith, SW; Lynch, MT",10.1111/j.1553-2712.1999.tb00164.x,,WOS:000079862700015,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Combined sonographic optic nerve sheath diameter and cerebral oximeter for predicting neurological outcome after cardiac arrest,"Cardiac arrest (CA) remains a critical global health issue with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Accurate prediction of neurological outcomes in post-CA patients is essential for optimizing management strategies. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) are emerging as promising tools for evaluating brain oxygenation and intracranial pressure (ICP). However, the potential benefits of combining these methods for improved prognostic accuracy have not been thoroughly explored. This study investigates whether the combined use of ultrasonographic ONSD and NIRS measurements enhances the prediction of neurological outcomes after CA. In this prospective study, ONSD measurements were obtained three times at 24-h intervals, while regional hemoglobin oxygen saturation (rSO2) using NIRS was recorded twice. Neurological outcomes were assessed using the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) and Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scores for both early and late evaluations. Results indicated that 47.5% of patients had poor outcomes and 52.5% had good outcomes based on the FOUR score, while 65% had poor outcomes and 35% had good outcomes according to the CPC score. The combination of ONSD and NIRS measurements showed superior prognostic performance compared to either method alone. While standalone NIRS measurements taken after 24 h exhibited limited predictive value, combining ONSD and NIRS provided a more reliable approach for neurological assessment in the short term following CA. This integrated method may improve prognostic accuracy and support better clinical decision making.",BIOMOLECULES AND BIOMEDICINE,2025,"Yazar, MA; Kozanhan, B; Tire, Y; Sekmenli, N; Yazar, G; Sevim, M",10.17305/bb.2024.11442,,WOS:001365994200001,A

A 52-year-old male presented following resuscitation after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. He had been followed in the cardiology outpatient clinic for a number of years for monitoring of bicuspid aortic valve and associated AR. Regular transthoracic echocardiography and one transesophageal echocardiogram had shown moderate range AR. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging reported the AR as severe with associated severely dilated left ventricle. Echocardiography grading and the patient's lack of symptoms supported a strategy of active surveillance. The presentation with cardiac arrest prompted re-evaluation of the severity of this patient's AR. Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance imaging re-affirmed severe AR, and the patient proceeded to surgical aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve. Post-operatively, the patient had heart failure with severely reduced ejection fraction. During hospital stay, he developed thyrotoxicosis secondary to amiodarone. This case demonstrates the discrepancy in assessing severity between different imaging techniques and highlights the potential complications in delayed intervention in AR.",JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASES,2025,"Nolan, P; Aodhabhui, BN; O'Hanlon, R; MacNeill, B",10.14740/jmc5177,,WOS:001636367400004,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Balloon arterioplasty of recurrent coarctation after the modified Norwood procedure in infants,"Coarctation of Be reconstructed aorta after the modified Norwood procedure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a relatively common occurrence that can have significant adverse effects. From 1992-98, 65 infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome or variants thereof underwent a modified Norwood procedure. Of the 50 survivors of Stage I palliation, 10 (20%) were subsequently diagnosed with clinically significant obstruction of the aortic arch at a median age of 5.1 months. Eight of these patients underwent coarctation balloon arterioplasty. All 8 patients underwent successful dilation of the coarctation, with a decrease in the pressure gradient from 43 +/- 20 to 4 +/- 5 mmHg and an increase in aortic diameter at the site of obstruction from 3.5 +/- 0.5 to 7.0 +/- 1.0 mm (both P < 0.001). There was also a significant increase in lower extremity systolic blood pressure. Although there was no immediate increase in cardiac output after dilation in most patients, ventricular function was improved in 3 patients within 24-48 hr of the procedure and in all but 2 at the most recent follow-up (median 2 years). Two patients developed bradycardia during wire placement that required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Two others died suddenly during the follow-up period. All surviving patients have undergone subsequent palliative procedures; none have required repeat intervention for arch obstruction. We found a 20% incidence of coarctation in survivors of the modified Norwood procedure. Balloon arterioplasty is effective in relieving this obstruction, and should be carried out promptly upon diagnosis to minimize its deleterious effects on ventricular function. Balloon dilation, however, should be considered a high-risk procedure in these fragile infants, and special attention must be given to cardiovascular support.

Automated cardiac arrest detection using sensor signals from smartwatches has the potential to shorten the interval between cardiac arrest and activation of EMS, thereby increasing the likelihood of survival. Objective: This cross-sectional survey study aims to investigate users' perspectives on aspects of continuous monitoring such as privacy and data protection, as well as other implications, and to collect insights into their attitudes toward the technology. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional web-based survey in the Netherlands among 2 groups of potential users of automated cardiac arrest technology: consumers who already own a smartwatch and patients at risk of cardiac arrest. Surveys primarily consisted of closed-ended questions with some additional open-ended questions to provide supplementary insight. The quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and a content analysis of the open-ended questions was conducted. Results: In the consumer group (n=1005), 90.2% (n=906; 95% CI 88.1%-91.9%) of participants expressed an interest in the technology, and 89% (n=1196; 95% CI 87.3%-90.7%) of the patient group (n=1344) showed interest. More than 75% (consumer group: n= 756; patient group: n=1004) of the participants in both groups indicated they were willing to use the technology.

The most successful intervention for the treatment of moderate to severe HIE is moderate whole body hypothermia initiated within 6 h from birth. The objective and prompt identification of infants who are at risk of developing moderate to severe HIE in the critical first hours still remains a challenge. This work proposes a metabolite score calculated based on the relative intensities of three metabolites (choline, 6,8-dihydroxypurine and hypoxanthine) that showed maximum correlation with hypoxia time in a consolidated piglet model for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. The metabolite score's performance as a biomarker for perinatal hypoxia and its usefulness for clinical grading and decision making have been assessed and compared to the performance of lactate which is currently considered the gold standard. For plasma samples withdrawn before and directly after a hypoxic insult, the metabolite score performed similar to lactate. However, it provided an enhanced predictive capacity at 2 h after resuscitation. The present study evidences the usefulness of the metabolite score for improving the early assessment of the severity of the hypoxic insult based on serial determinations in a minimally invasive biofluid.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not the hemodynamic and inflammatory effects of hypertonic saline (HS) protect the kidney by promoting renal microcirculatory oxygenation and possible deleterious effects of HS due to its high sodium content on renal functional and structural injury following ischemia/reperfusion. Mechanically ventilated and anesthetized ratswere randomly divided into four groups (n = 6 per group): a sham-operated control group; a group subjected to renal ischemia for 45 min by supra-aortic occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion (I/R); and I/R group treated with a continuous i.v. infusion (5 mL/kg/h) of either % 0.9 NaCl (IR+NS) or % 10 NaCl (I/R+HS) after releasing the clamp. Systemic and renal hemodynamic, renal cortical (C mu PO2), and medullar microcirculatory pO(2) (M mu PO2) are measured by the oxygen-dependent quenching of the phosphorescence lifetime technique. Renal functional, inflammatory, and tissues damage parameters were also assessed. HS, but not NS, treatment restored I/R-induced reduced mean arterial pressure, C mu PO2, renal oxygen deliver (DO2ren), and consumption (VO2ren). HS caused a decrease in tubular sodium reabsorption (TNa+) that correlated with an elevation of fractional sodium excretion (EFNa+) and urine output. HS had an anti-inflammatory effect by reducing the levels TNF-alpha, IL-6, and hyaluronic acid in the renal tissue samples as compared with the I/R and I/R+NS groups (P < 0.05). HS treatment was also associated with mild acidosis and an increased renal tubular damage.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Euglycemic DKA in a DPP-4 inhibitor patient following traumatic brain injury: A complex ICU glucose management challenge,"Rationale: Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) is a rare variant of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), characterized by normal or near-normal glucose levels despite severe metabolic acidosis and ketosis. This condition poses a diagnostic challenge as it mimics DKA without the hallmark hyperglycemia. Recent studies have suggested an association between EuDKA and newer antidiabetic medications, including dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Patient concern:A 57-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis developed EuDKA following a traumatic brain injury. Despite a blood glucose of 134 mg/dL, he exhibited classic features of DKA, including severe metabolic acidosis, low bicarbonate levels, an elevated anion gap, and positive urinary ketones. Diagnosis:Despite the blood glucose level being within normal range, the patient's clinical presentation, including severe acidosis (pH 7.16), low bicarbonate (2.8 mmol/L), elevated anion gap (24.9 mmol/L), and urinary ketones, pointed to EuDKA. The patient's use of Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, was identified as a likely precipitating factor. Interventions:Timely interventions, including fluid resuscitation, insulin therapy, and electrolyte correction, were promptly administered to manage the patient's metabolic abnormalities. Outcome:After receiving intensive treatment, the patient made a full recovery with normalization of metabolic parameters and no long-term complications.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Pyruvate as a Potential Beneficial Anion in Resuscitation Fluids,"There have been ongoing debates about resuscitation fluids because each of the current fluids has its own disadvantages. The debates essentially reflect an embarrassing clinical status quo that all fluids are not quite ideal in most clinical settings. Therefore, a novel fluid that overcomes the limitations of most fluids is necessary for most patients, particularly diabetic and older patients. Pyruvate is a natural potent antioxidant/nitrosative and anti-inflammatory agent. Exogenous pyruvate as an alkalizer can increase cellular hypoxia and anoxia tolerance with the preservation of classic glycolytic pathways and the reactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity to promote oxidative metabolism and reverse the Warburg effect, robustly preventing and treating hypoxic lactic acidosis, which is one of the fatal complications in critically ill patients. In animal studies and clinical reports, pyruvate has been shown to play a protective role in multi-organ functions, especially the heart, brain, kidney, and intestine, demonstrating a great potential to improve patient survival. Pyruvate-enriched fluids including crystalloids and colloids and oral rehydration solution (ORS) may be ideal due to the unique beneficial properties of pyruvate relative to anions in contemporary existing fluids, such as acetate, bicarbonate, chloride, citrate, lactate, and even malate. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that pyruvate-enriched saline is superior to 0.9% sodium chloride. Moreover, pyruvate-enriched Ringer's solution is advantageous over lactated Ringer's solution. Furthermore, pyruvate as a carrier in colloids, such as hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4, is more beneficial than its commercial counterparts. Similarly, pyruvate-enriched ORS is more favorable than WHO-ORS in organ protection and shock resuscitation. It is critical that pay attention first to improving abnormal saline with pyruvate for ICU patients. Many clinical trials with a high dose of intravenous or oral pyruvate were conducted over the past half century, and results indicated its effectiveness and safety in humans. The long-term instability of pyruvate aqueous solutions and para-pyruvate cytotoxicity is not a barrier to the pharmaceutical manufacturing of pyruvate-enriched fluids for ICU patients. Clinical trials with sodium pyruvate-enriched solutions are urgently warranted.",FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE,2022,"Zhou, FQ",10.3389/fmed.2022.905978,,WOS:000841398200001,A

Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have demonstrated promise in small animal models of neurologic injury. To investigate the effects of exosome treatment in a clinically realistic large animal model, Yorkshire swine underwent TBI and HS. Animals were maintained in shock for 2 h before resuscitation with normal saline (NS). Animals were then resuscitated either with NS (3 x volume of shed blood) or with the same volume of NS with delayed exosome administration (1 x 10(13) particles/4 mL) (n = 5/cohort). Exosomes were administered 9 h post-injury, and on post-injury days (PID) 1, 5, 9, and 13. Neurologic severity scores (NSS) were assessed for 30 days, and neurocognitive functions were objectively measured. Exosome-treated animals had significantly lower NSS (p < 0.05) during the first five days of recovery. Exosome-treated animals also had a significantly shorter time to complete neurologic recovery (NSS = 0) compared with animals given NS alone (days to recovery: NS = 16.8 +/- 10.6; NS + exosomes = 5.6 +/- 2.8; p = 0.03). Animals treated with exosomes initiated neurocognitive testing earlier (days to initiation: NS = 9.6 +/- 0.5 vs. NS + exosomes = 4.2 +/- 0.8; p = 0.008); however, no difference was seen in time to mastery of tasks.

Methods A national paediatric HCM cohort (n = 151), presenting <19 years of age, mean follow-up 13.3 years, from all Swedish centres of Paediatric Cardiology (presenting 1972-2015), with 41 RAS-HCM patients (61% males), and 110 ns-HCM patients (68% familial; 65% males). The end-point was a composite of sudden cardiac death and resuscitated cardiac arrest (SCD/CA). Risk-factors were studied with Cox-hazard regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (C-statistic). Results There were 33 SCD/CA, 27/110 in ns-HCM and 6/41 in RAS-HCM (p = 0.27).

Ambulance response times vary widely across Norway, particularly between urban and rural municipalities. Advances in digital health technologies may encourage earlier patient contact with emergency services, potentially mitigating these delays.Methods We analyzed official response time data from four Norwegian municipalities representing diverse geographic contexts (Bergen, Tokke, Lur & oslash;y, S & oslash;rfold). Using a survival decay function (Equation), we simulated changes in survival probability under scenarios where emergency calls were placed 1, 5, or 10 min earlier than observed.Results Baseline survival probabilities varied substantially across municipalities, from 47.7% in Bergen (mean response 10.2 min) to 9.3% in Lur & oslash;y (32.8 min). Simulated earlier calls produced marked gains: in Bergen, survival increased from 47.7% to 68.6% with a five-minute advance; in S & oslash;rfold, from 19.4% to 27.9%; and in Tokke, from 29.9% to 43.1%. Even modest improvements (1-2 min) yielded meaningful survival benefits.Conclusions Geographic disparities in emergency response times strongly influence survival after cardiac arrest.

First published February 20, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajpheart.00338.2008.-We have previously reported that postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction is accompanied by the release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 activation. We now investigated the role of caspase-3 activation by examining whether such process prompts apoptotic DNA fragmentation, whether caspase-3 inhibition attenuates myocardial dysfunction, and whether myocardial protective effects of sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-1 (NHE-1) inhibition involve caspase-3 inhibition using a rat model of ventricular fibrillation (VF) of closed-chest resuscitation. Resuscitation after 4 or 8 min of untreated VF caused significant reductions in left ventricular stroke work index averaging 23% of sham control rats at 4 h postresuscitation. Left ventricular dysfunction was accompanied by increases in cytosolic cytochrome c, decreases in pro-and cleaved caspase-9 fragments, increases in 17-kDa caspase-3 fragments, and increases in caspase-3 activity indicating the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway but without evidence of apoptotic DNA fragmentation. In addition, levels of heat shock protein 70 were increased and levels of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and alpha beta-crystallin were preserved, all of which can exert antiapoptotic effects. In a separate series, the caspase-3 inhibitor z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp chloromethyl ketone given before the induction of VF failed to prevent postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction despite reductions in caspase-3 activity (2.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.5 pmol fluorophore AFC released.mg protein(-1).min(-1); P < 0.03). Treatment with the NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide had no effect on caspase-3 activity. Accordingly, in this rat model of VF and severe postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction, activation of caspase-3 did not lead to DNA fragmentation or contribute to myocardial dysfunction. Concomitant activation of intrinsic antiapoptotic mechanisms could play a protective role downstream to caspase-3 activation.",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY,2009,"Radhakrishnan, J; Ayoub, IM; Gazmuri, RJ",10.1152/ajpheart.00338.2008,,WOS:000265658600031,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Burn wound conversion: clinical implications for the treatment of severe burns,"The identification of novel treatments for severe burn wounds relies on accurate clinical assessments of the extent of injury. However, evaluation of burn wound depth can be challenging due to the tendency for burn wounds to progress over time in a little-understood process known as `burn wound conversion'. Local factors affecting the burn wound, such as inflammation, oxidative stress-induced tissue damage, vasostasis and bacterial infections, lead to increased cell death by apoptosis or oncosis, while systemic events may promote burn wound conversion. Acute shock, metabolic derangements, age or immunomodulation can modify cytokine secretion, lower immune responses, decrease blood flow or cause bacterial infection at the burn wound site. Therefore, therapeutic approaches targeting specific mechanisms that reduce cell death, improve wound reperfusion and promote tissue regrowth should favourably enhance burn wound healing, and long-term functional and aesthetic outcomes. Our current understanding of these mechanisms mostly comes from animal studies, underscoring the need for extensive research in humans. A streamlined approach would be to investigate the parallels in other disease states that exhibit ischaemia and potential reperfusion, such as ischaemic stroke and myocardial infarction. Moreover, in view of the limited knowledge available on the subject, the need exists for further clinical research into burn wound conversion and novel target pathways to ameliorate its effects.

The neonates, elderly population and chronically ill and long-term hospitalized patients are predominantly vulnerable to sepsis and related cerebral damage. Generally, electrophysiological recordings, severity and sedation scales, computerized imaging and spectroscopy techniques are used for its detection and diagnosis. About the underlying mechanisms, enhanced blood-brain barrier permeability and metalloprotease activity, tight junction protein loss and endothelial cell degeneration promote the influx of inflammatory and toxic mediators into the brain, triggering cerebrovascular damage. An altered neutrophil count and phenotype further dysregulate the normal neuroimmune responses and neuroendocrine stability via modulated activation of protein kinase C-delta, nuclear factor kappa-B and sphingolipid signaling. Glial activation, together with pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the Toll-like receptor, destabilize the immune system. Moreover, superoxides and hydroperoxides generate oxidative stress and perturb mitochondrial dynamics and ATP synthesis, propagating neuronal injury cycle. Activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, characterized by increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 cleavage and Bax/Bcl2 ratio in the hippocampal and cortical neurons, stimulate neurocognitive impairments. Additionally, altered LC3-II/I and P62/SQSTM1, p-mTOR, p-AMPK1 and p-ULK1 levels and dysregulated autophagosome-lysosome fusion decrease neuronal and glial energy homeostasis.

However, the ability of MEx to reverse the long-term pulmonary complications associated with established BPD remains unknown. In this study, MEx were isolated from media conditioned by human Wharton's Jelly-derived MSC cultures. Newborn mice (FVB strain) were exposed to hyperoxia (HYRX (75% O2)) before returning to room air at postnatal day 14 (PN14). Following prolonged HYRX-exposure, animals received a single MEx dose at PN18 or serial MEx treatments at PN18-39 (""late"" intervention). This group was compared to animals that received an early single MEx dose at PN4 (""early"" intervention). Animals were harvested at PN28 or 60 for assessment of pulmonary parameters. We found that early and late MEx interventions effectively ameliorated core features of HYRX-induced neonatal lung injury, improving alveolar simplification, pulmonary fibrosis, vascular remodelling and blood vessel loss. Exercise capacity testing and assessment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) showed functional improvements following both early and late MEx interventions. In conclusion, delivery of MEx following prolonged HYRX-exposure improves core features of experimental BPD, restoring lung architecture, decreasing pulmonary fibrosis and vascular muscularization, ameliorating PH and improving exercise capacity.

Despite the promising long-term survival outcomes and optimization of pathological complete response (cPR) demonstrated by various studies such as Impower010 and Checkmate-816, the effectiveness of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced resectable NSCLC remains a subject of debate. Although previous research has explored the connection between the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy and surgical-related safety, limited studies have specifically investigated the surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Therefore, our study aims to assess the efficacy and surgical-related safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in advanced resectable non-small cell lung cancer.MethodWe conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of 93 patients with stage IIIA-IIIC NSCLC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection. Among them, 53 patients received neoadjuvant immunotherapy, 18 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy while the remaining 22 underwent neoadjuvant targeted therapy. The patients were separated into further groups according to their pathological type. Data analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test.ResultsAll patients were categorized into six distinct groups. Notably, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy squamous carcinoma group exhibited a favorable edge over the neoadjuvant targeted squamous carcinoma group concerning the duration of drainage tube indwelling and the extent of lymph node dissection. Furthermore, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy adenocarcinoma group outperformed neoadjuvant targeted therapy adenocarcinoma counterpart in terms of achieving complete pathological response (cPR). Simultaneously, the neoadjuvant immunotherapy adenocarcinoma group surpassed the neoadjuvant chemotherapy adenocarcinoma group in the incidence of hydrothorax. Nevertheless, no statistically significant disparities were noted between the neoadjuvant immunotherapy squamous carcinoma group and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy carcinoma group.ConclusionRegarding surgical outcomes, neoadjuvant immunotherapy conferred notable advantages compared to conventional neoadjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant targeted therapy for patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. In the case of squamous carcinoma, neoadjuvant immunotherapy exhibited superiority over neoadjuvant targeted therapy, although additional evidence is required to conclusively establish its precedence over neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY,2023,"Wang, Q; Qi, C; Luo, J; Xu, N; Xu, MT; Qiang, Y; Zhang, C; Shen, Y",10.3389/fonc.2023.1239451,,WOS:001136521800001,A

This study was designed to examine and compare the effects of an iron chelator (deferoxamine) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) on brain lipid peroxidation and tissue ions after eight hours of reperfusion following a 15-minute cardiac arrest. This sampling time was chosen because other work with this model has shown severe ionic and ultrastructural derangement at this point. Twenty-three dogs were anesthetized with ketamine and halothane and divided into four groups. Six dogs were nonischemic controls (group I). In the remaining dogs, a 15-minute cardiac arrest was induced with KCI. Resuscitation was begun with internal cardiac massage and artificial ventilation. After five minutes of artificial perfusion, internal defibrillation was perfomred to restart the heart. All dogs were resuscitated and supported by a standard intensive care (SIC) protocol for eight hours. Six resuscitated dogs served as SIC control (group II). Six were treated with deferoxamine, 200 mg/kg loading dose and 100 mg/kg/h maintenance drip (group III), and five were treated with SOD, 1,000,000 units bolus and 500,000 units/h drip (group IV). All drugs were administered intravenously immediately postresuscitation. At eight hours postresuscitation, a 3-g portion of parietal cerebral cortex was obtained through a trephine hole. The sample was assayed for tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) by the thiobarbituric acid test, the double bond content of the tissue lipids (lipid unsaturation index, LUSI), and total tissue content of K and Na. Deferoxamine treatment inhibited peroxidation of brain lipids by both the MDA and LUSI assays, and protected tissue K/NA ratio. SOD treatment inhibited only MDA.

Objective: This study aimed to examine complications arising from ACS in patients admitted to a tertiary hospital and identify the influencing factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between February and December 2021 among patients diagnosed with ACS at the tertiary hospital in Northeastern Thailand. The sample included 133 participants hospitalized for ACS. Simple random sampling was employed, with data collected from the patient registry by selecting 15 individuals at a time until the target of 1,998 patients was reached. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, Chi-Square test, Fisher's exact test, and binary logistic regression to identify significant predictors of complications in this population. Results: Factors influencing the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) included cardiac function and the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV had a significantly higher risk of MACE compared to those with NYHA class I (p <0.001; 95% CI, 2.008-10.984). Additionally, patients who received CPR were 4.15 times more likely to experience MACE than those who did not receive CPR (p <0.05; 95% CI, 1.029-16.729). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that cardiac function and the necessity for CPR significantly influence the development of MACE in patients with ACS. These findings highlight the importance of thorough evaluation and monitoring by healthcare teams during hospitalization, particularly for patients with abnormal cardiac function or a history of CPR. Prompt identification and targeted interventions for high-risk individuals can improve outcomes and reduce complications. Nurses should prioritize follow-up evaluations for ACS patients with NYHA class II-IV or those who have undergone CPR, as these individuals are at elevated risk for developing MACE.",BELITUNG NURSING JOURNAL,2025,"Piwpong, R; Plienthaisong, B; Plongram, T; Ngaosri, W; Narasri, T",10.33546/bnj.3672,,WOS:001472845200001,A

Some patients also experience neurological signs and symptoms ranging from anosmia, ageusia, headache, nausea, and vomiting to confusion, encephalitis, and stroke. Approximately 36% of those with severe COVID-19 experience neurological complications. The virus may enter the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity and damage neurons in the brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of respiration. Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) are particularly vulnerable to severe outcome if they contract COVID-19 because of the complexity of their disease, the presence of comorbidities, and their use of immunosuppressive therapies. Most CA patients burdened by progressive neurologic deficits have substantially impaired mobility and other essential functions, for which they rely heavily on ambulatory services, including rehabilitation and psychosocial care. Cessation of these interventions because of isolation restrictions places the CA patient population at risk of further deterioration. This international panel of ataxia experts provides recommendations for neurologists caring for patients with CA, emphasizing a pro-active approach designed to maintain their autonomy and well-being: continue long-term medications, promote rehabilitation efforts, utilize the technology of virtual visits for regular contact with healthcare providers, and pay attention to emotional and psychosocial health. Neurologists should play an active role in decision-making in those CA cases requiring escalation to intensive care and resuscitation.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Continuous evaluation of neurological prognosis after cardiac arrest,"Post-resuscitation care has changed in the last decade, and outcome after cardiac arrest has improved, thanks to several combined measures. Induced hypothermia has shown a treatment benefit in two randomized trials, but some doubts remain. General care has improved, including the use of emergency coronary intervention. Assessment of neurological function and prognosis in comatose cardiac arrest patient is challenging, especially when treated with hypothermia. In this review, we evaluate the recent literature and discuss the available evidence for prognostication after cardiac arrest in the era of temperature management. Relevant literature was identified searching PubMed and reading published papers in the field, but no standardized search strategy was used. The complexity of predicting outcome after cardiac arrest and induced hypothermia is recognized in the literature, and no single test can predict a poor prognosis with absolute certainty. A clinical neurological examination is still the gold standard, but the results need careful interpretation because many patients are affected by sedatives and by hypothermia. Common adjuncts include neurophysiology, brain imaging and biomarkers, and a multimodal strategy is generally recommended. Current guidelines for prediction of outcome after cardiac arrest and induced hypothermia are not sufficient. Based on our expert opinion, we suggest a multimodal approach with a continuous evaluation of prognosis based on repeated neurological examinations and electroencephalography. Somatosensory-evoked potential is an established method to help determine a poor outcome and is recommended, whereas biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging are promising adjuncts. We recommend that a decisive evaluation of prognosis is performed at 72?h after normothermia or later in a patient free of sedative and analgetic drugs.",ACTA ANAESTHESIOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA,2013,"Friberg, H; Rundgren, M; Westhall, E; Nielsen, N; Cronberg, T",10.1111/j.1399-6576.2012.02736.x,,WOS:000312271800003,A

Immediate management consists of resuscitation, supportive care, and thrombolysis for patients with haemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism (PE) or limb-threatening deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). Patients with contraindications to anticoagulants are considered for vena cava filters. Disposition for the acute treatment of VTE is then considered based on published risk scores and the patient's social status, as the first seven days carries the highest risk for VTE recurrence, extension and bleeding due to anticoagulation. Next, a review of: immediate and long-term bleeding risk, comorbidities (i.e. active cancer, renal failure, obesity, thrombophilia), medications, patient preference, VTE location and potential for pregnancy should be undertaken. This will help determine the most suitable anticoagulant for immediate treatment.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Peptidoglycan Remodeling in Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Comparison of Structures and Catalytic Activities of RipA and RipB,"The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sustaining long-term survival within the host macrophages partly relies on its unique cell envelop that also confers low susceptibility to several antibiotics. Remodeling of the septal peptidoglycan (PG) has been linked to the putative PG hydrolases RipA and RipB. The crystal structures of RipB (Rv1478) and the homologous module of RipA (Rv1477) were determined to 1.60 angstrom and 1.38 angstrom resolution, respectively. Both proteins contain a C-terminal core domain resembling the NlpC-type PG hydrolases. However, the structure of RipB exhibits striking differences to the structures of this domain in RipA reported here and previously by others. Major structural differences were found in the N-terminal segments of 70 amino acids and in an adjacent loop, which form part of the substrate binding groove. Both RipA and RipB are able to bind PG. RipA, its C-terminal module and RipB cleave defined PG fragments between D-glutamate and mesodiaminopimelate with pH optima of 5 and 6, respectively. The peptidase module of RipA is also able to degrade Bacillus subtilis PG, which displays peptide stems and cross-links identical with those found in mycobacterial murein. RipB did not show comparable hydrolase activity with this substrate. Removal of the N-terminal segments previously suggested to have a role in auto-inhibition did not change the activity of either RipA or RipB. A comparison of the putative active-site clefts in the two enzymes provides structural insights into the basis of the differences in their substrate specificity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study assesses the impact of AF type on treatment outcomes in the Catheter Ablation vs. Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation Trial (CABANA). Methods and results CABANA randomized 2204 patients >= 65 years old or <65 with at least one risk factor for stroke to catheter ablation or drug therapy. Of these, 946 (42.9%) had paroxysmal AF (PAF), 1042 (47.3%) had persistent AF (PersAF), and 215 (9.8%) had long-standing persistent AF (LSPAF) at baseline. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Symptoms were measured with the Mayo AF-Specific Symptom Inventory (MAFSI), and quality of life was measured with the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality of Life (AFEQT). Comparisons are reported by intention to treat. Compared with drug therapy alone, catheter ablation produced a 19% relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint for PAF {adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50, 1.30]}, and a 17% relative reduction for PersAF (aHR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.22). For LSPAF, the ablation relative effect was a 7% reduction (aHR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.36, 2.44). Ablation was more effective than drug therapy at reducing first AF recurrence in all AF types: by 51% for PAF (aHR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.62), by 47% for PersAF (aHR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.43,0.65), and by 36% for LSPAF (aHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41,1.00). Ablation was associated with greater improvement in symptoms, with the mean difference between groups in the MAFSI frequency score favouring ablation over 5 years of follow-up in all subgroups: PAF had a clinically significant -1.9-point difference (95% CI: -1.2 to -2.6); PersAF a -0.9 difference (95% CI: -0.2 to -1.6); LSPAF a clinically significant difference of -1.6 points (95% CI: -0.1 to -3.1). Ablation was also associated with greater improvement in quality of life in all subgroups, with the AFEQT overall score in PAF patients showing a clinically significant 5.3-point improvement (95% CI: 3.3 to 7.3) over drug therapy alone over 5 years of follow-up, PersAF a 1.7-point difference (95% CI: 0.0 to 3.7), and LSPAF a 3.1-point difference (95% CI: -1.6 to 7.8). Conclusion Prognostic treatment effects of catheter ablation compared with drug therapy on the primary and major secondary clinical endpoints did not differ consequentially by AF subtype. With regard to decreases in AF recurrence and improving quality of life, ablation was more effective than drug therapy in all three AF type subgroups.

These dysrhythmias carry high morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and abated promptly. When traditional resuscitative algorithms fail to return a patient to a perfusing rhythm, providers need to consider other, more novel techniques to terminate these dangerous dysrhythmias. One approach is the use of a stellate ganglion block, which has been documented in the literature only a handful of times for its resuscitative use in cardiac arrest. Case Series: This case series details two cases from an urban emergency department (ED) in a large metropolitan city, where the use of ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion blocks during cardiac arrest provided successful ablation of the tachydysrhythmia. The first case involves a patient who went into cardiac arrest while in the ED and was found to be in refractory pulseless ventricular tachycardiawhile. The second case describes a patient who went into a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest while with emergency medical services. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: The stellate ganglion block is a procedure currently being used as a treatment modality for a variety of neurologic, psychological, and cardiac conditions. This intervention may provide a viable and lifesaving option for emergency physicians to adopt when traditional resuscitative algorithms fail to break resistant ventricular tachydysrhythmias.

Methods A literature search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica database, Psychological Information Database, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials) was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies up to 18 April 2021. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and main secondary outcome was neurological function with additional secondary outcomes being survival, rehospitalisation, safety (serious and non-serious adverse events), psychological well-being, fatigue, exercise capacity and physical capacity. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results Three RCTs and 11 observational studies were included (total 721 participants). Study duration ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Pooled data from two RCTs showed low-quality evidence for no effect on physical HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.19, (95% CI: -0.09 to 0.47)) and no effect on mental HRQoL (SMD 0.27 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.55)). Regarding secondary outcomes, very low-quality evidence was found for improvement in neurological function associated with inpatient rehabilitation for CA survivors with acquired brain injury (SMD 0.71, (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.96)) from five observational studies. Two small observational studies found exercise-based rehabilitation interventions to be safe for CA survivors, reporting no serious or non-serious events. Conclusions Given the overall low quality of evidence, this review cannot determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for CA survivors on HRQoL, neurological function or other included outcomes, and recommend further high-quality studies be conducted. In the interim, existing clinical guidelines on rehabilitation provision after CA should be followed to meet the high burden of secondary consequences suffered by CA survivors.

This process is promoted in part by the opening of endothelial cell adherens junctions that allows leukocyte extravasation through gaps between adjacent endothelial cells. VE-cadherin is a key component of endothelial cell adherens junctions and a negative regulator of leukocyte emigration. Accumulating evidence implicates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 as a critical regulator in vascular biology, but its role in leukocyte extravasation in vitro and in vivo has not been investigated so far. To assess the impact of BMP4 on leukocyte emigration in vivo, we used the thioglycollate-induced peritonitis model. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with recombinant BMP4 in addition to thioglycollate. Compared to solvent-treated controls, we observed higher accumulation of leukocytes in the peritoneal lavage of BMP4-treated mice indicating that BMP4 promotes leukocyte diapedesis into the inflamed peritoneal cavity. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of BMP4 in mice markedly diminished leukocyte diapedesis following thioglycollate administration suggesting that endothelial BMP4 is required for leukocyte recruitment. Consistent with these in vivo results, transwell migration assays with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro revealed that recombinant BMP4 enhanced leukocyte transmigration through the endothelial monolayer. Conversely, silencing of endothelial BMP4 by siRNA dampened leukocyte diapedesis in vitro. Mechanistic studies showed that loss of BMP4 improved endothelial junction stability by upregulation of VE-cadherin expression in vitro and in vivo. Vice versa, treatment of HUVECs with recombinant BMP4 decreased expression of VE-cadherin and impaired endothelial junction stability shown by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Finally, severe endothelial damage in HUVECs in response to serum of patients collected 24 h after survived cardiac arrest was accompanied by increase in leukocyte migration in transwell assays and activation of the BMP pathway most probably by upregulation of endothelial BMP4 RNA and protein expression. Collectively, the present study provides novel evidence that endothelial BMP4 controls leukocyte recruitment through a VE-cadherin-dependent mechanism and that BMP4-induced inflammation might be involved in the pathogenesis of endothelial cell damage following successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest.",INFLAMMATION,2017,"Helbing, T; Arnold, L; Wiltgen, G; Hirschbihl, E; Gabelmann, V; Hornstein, A; Esser, JS; Diehl, P; Grundmann, S; Busch, HJ; Fink, K; Bode, C; Moser, M",10.1007/s10753-017-0627-0,,WOS:000413812900005,A

Life satisfaction on the other hand has not yet been studied in a large scale in the CA population. We aimed to explore life satisfaction as perceived by CA survivors with three research questions addressed: (1) how do CA survivors report their life satisfaction, (2) how are different domains of life satisfaction associated with overall life satisfaction, and (3) how are demographic and medical factors associated with overall life satisfaction?Methods: This registry study had a cross-sectional design. Life satisfaction was assessed using the 11-item Life Satisfaction checklist (LiSat-11). The sample included 1435 survivors >= 18 years of age. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analyses were used.Results: Survivors were most satisfied with partner relation (85.6%), family life (82.2%), and self-care (77.8%), while 60.5% were satisfied with overall life. Satisfaction with psychological health was strongest associated with overall life satisfaction. Among medical and demographic factors, female sex and poor cerebral performance were associated with less overall life satisfaction.Conclusions: Generally, CA survivors seem to perceive similar levels of overall life satisfaction as general populations, while survivors tend to be significantly less satisfied with their sexual life. Satisfaction with psychological health is of special interest to identify and treat. Additionally, female survivors and survivors with poor neurological outcome are at risk for poorer overall life satisfaction and need special attention by healthcare professionals.",RESUSCITATION PLUS,2023,"Lundh, SA; Israelsson, J; Hagell, P; Andersson, PL; Årestedt, K",10.1016/j.resplu.2023.100451,,WOS:001144737200001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Update on critical care for acute spinal cord injury in the setting of polytrauma,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) often occurs in patients with concurrent traumatic injuries in other body systems. These patients with polytrauma pose unique challenges to clinicians. The current review evaluates existing guidelines and updates the evidence for prehospital transport, immobilization, initial resuscitation, critical care, hemodynamic stability, diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, and timing appropriate for the patient with SCI who has multisystem trauma. Initial management should be systematic, with focus on spinal immobilization, timely transport, and optimizing perfusion to the spinal cord. There is general evidence for the maintenance of mean arterial pressure of > 85 mm Hg during immediate and acute care to optimize neurological outcome; however, the selection of vasopressor type and duration should be judicious, with considerations for level of injury and risks of increased cardiogenic complications in the elderly. Level II recommendations exist for early decompression, and additional time points of neurological assessment within the first 24 hours and during acute care are warranted to determine the temporality of benefits attributable to early surgery. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using low-molecular-weight heparin is recommended by current guidelines for SCI. For these patients, titration of tidal volumes is important to balance the association of earlier weaning off the ventilator, with its risk of atelectasis, against the risk for lung damage from mechanical overinflation that can occur with prolonged ventilation. Careful evaluation of infection risk is a priority following multisystem trauma for patients with relative immunosuppression or compromise. Although patients with polytrauma may experience longer rehabilitation courses, long-term neurological recovery is generally comparable to that in patients with isolated SCI after controlling for demographics. Bowel and bladder disorders are common following SCI, significantly reduce quality of life, and constitute a focus of targeted therapies. Emerging biomarkers including glial fibrillary acidic protein, S100b, and microRNAs for traumatic SCIs are presented.

The diagnosis is difficult to make in the perioperative setting, but prompt recognition and correct treatment is necessary to ensure a good outcome. A group of 26 international experts in perioperative allergy (anaesthesiologists, allergists, and immunologists) contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process, which covered areas such as differential diagnosis, management during and after anaphylaxis, allergy investigations, and plans for a subsequent anaesthetic. They were asked to rank the appropriateness of statements related to the immediate management of suspected perioperative allergic reactions. Statements were selected to represent areas where there is a lack of consensus in existing guidelines, such as dosing of epinephrine and fluids, the management of impending cardiac arrest, and reactions refractory to standard treatment. The results of the modified Delphi consensus process have been included in the recommendations on the management of suspected perioperative allergic reactions.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Study protocol for a randomized trial on timely delivery versus expectant management in late preterm small for gestational age pregnancies with an abnormal umbilicocerebral ratio (UCR): the DRIGITAT study,"Background: The clinical inability to correctly identify late fetal growth restriction (FGR) within a group of fetuses who are identified as small for gestational age (SGA) is an everyday problem for all obstetrician-gynecologists. This leads to substantial overtreatment of healthy small fetuses but also inadequate detection of the growth-restricted fetuses that may benefit from timely delivery. Redistribution of the fetal circulation, signaled by an abnormal ratio of the Doppler velocity flow profiles of the umbilical artery and the middle cerebral artery, more specifically an increased umbilicocerebral ratio (UCR) (or its inverse: a decreased cerebroplacental ratio (CPR)), is an adaptation to chronic hypoxemia and nutritional scarcity with long-term consequences in survivors. The relevance of an abnormal UCR has been signaled extensively, and there is a general consensus that it is a signal of FGR, independent of size, with a strong association with poor outcomes. Yet, in the current literature, no comparisons of a monitoring-delivery strategy based on unfavorable UCR have been published. The objective of the Doppler Ratio In fetal Growth restriction Intervention Trial At (near) Term (DRIGITAT) is to evaluate if the timing of the delivery based on an abnormal UCR in late preterm fetuses identified as SGA improves neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age.",TRIALS,2022,"Smies, M; Damhuis, SE; Duijnhoven, RG; Leemhuis, AG; Gordijn, SJ; Ganzevoort, W",10.1186/s13063-022-06561-w,,WOS:000834806700005,A

N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor- mediated excitotoxicity is a well-established mechanism of cell death in several brain regions, but the role of NMDA receptors in PC injury remains understudied. Emerging data in cortical and hippocampal neurons indicate that the GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors signal to improve cell survival and GluN2B-containing receptors contribute to neuronal injury. This study compared neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 region to that in PCs and investigated the role of NMDA receptors in PC injury in our mouse model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Analysis of cell density demonstrated a 24% loss of PCs within 24 h after 8 min CA/CPR and injury stabilized to 33% by 7 days. The subunit promiscuous NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 protected both CA1 neurons and PCs from ischemic injury following CA/CPR, demonstrating a role for NMDA receptor activation in injury to both brain regions. In contrast, the GluN2B antagonist, Co 101244, had no effect on PC loss while protecting against injury in the CA1 region. These data indicate that ischemic injury to cerebellar PCs progresses via different cell death mechanisms compared to hippocampal CA1 neurons. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Can catheter ablation in cardiac arrest survivors prevent ventricular fibrillation recurrence?,"Ventricular tachyarrhythmias are the most common cause for sudden cardiac death. The success of catheter ablation for supraventricular tachycardias led to the supposition that ablation could also be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardias. Despite the promising results in bundle branch reentry and some forms of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, the success rate in patients with coronary artery disease is still low. There is hope that new approaches to reliably localize the critical region of the tachycardia and new ablation techniques to create larger areas of injury may lead to a wider application of ablation therapy in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia. Survivors of cardiac arrest typically have more rapid and unstable arrhythmias than patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, and these rapid arrhythmias frequently degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. The instability of the arrhythmia makes it impossible to localize the arrhythmia origin with current mapping techniques. Experimental and clinical data, however, suggest that these arrhythmias also frequently start from a localized area of electrical activation. With developments in mapping techniques and energy delivery, catheter ablation may soon become a feasible therapeutic approach in some patients with unstable arrhythmias. The article discusses the prerequisites for this approach and suggests the patients who may be appropriate candidates for this technique.",PACE-PACING AND CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,1997,"Reek, S; Klein, HU; Ideker, RE",10.1111/j.1540-8159.1997.tb03575.x,,WOS:A1997XL83800015,A

Case study:A patient with near fatal asthma (NFA) and COPD presented with high airway resistance, life-threatening acidemia and severe hypoxemia that failed to respond to conventional therapy. His hospital course was complicated by sudden cardiac arrest when preparing to initiate V-V mode extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The mode immediately changed from V-V to V-A, then to V-AV and finally to V-V mode in order to improve cardiac function and promote recovery of lung function. Results:On the sixth day, ECMO was removed and on the ninth day, he was extubated and transferred to the ward. Finally, the patient was discharged home on the nineteenth day after admission to be followed up in the pulmonary clinic.

Hypersensitivity reactions to environmental antigens cause an allergic inflammatory response in the equine airways. Cytosine- phosphate- guanosine- oligodeoxynucleotides ( CpG- ODN) are known to direct the immune system toward a Th1- pathway, and away from the pro- allergic Th2- line ( Th2/ Th1- shift). Gelatin nanoparticles ( GNPs) are biocompatible and biodegradable immunological inert drug delivery systems that protect CpG- ODN against nuclease degeneration. Preliminary studies on the inhalation of GNP- bound CpG- ODN in RAO- affected horses have shown promising results. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and immunological effects of GNP- bound CpG- ODN in a double- blinded, placebo- controlled, prospective, randomized clinical trial and to verify a sustained effect post- treatment. Animals and Methods: Twenty- four RAO- affected horses received 1 inhalation every 2 days for 5 consecutive administrations. Horses were examined for clinical, endoscopic, cytological, and blood biochemical variables before the inhalation regimen ( I), immediately afterwards ( II), and 4 weeks post- treatment ( III). Results: At time points I and II, administration of treatment rather than placebo corresponded to a statistically significant decrease in respiratory effort, nasal discharge, tracheal secretion, and viscosity, AaDO2 and neutrophil percentage, and an increase in arterial oxygen pressure. Conclusion and Clinical Importance: Administration of a GNP- bound CpG- ODN formulation caused a potent and persistent effect on allergic and inflammatory- induced clinical variables in RAO- affected horses.

Amputation and limb reconstruction are the two options that clinicians must choose. This study aims to comprehensively synthesize existing tools and resources from the literature that can assist clinicians in the decision-making process.Evaluation: The initial resuscitation and the prehospital care are the first important steps in the management of these injuries, while the immediate transfer to trauma centers is recommended for complex cases. After the stabilization of the patient, a thorough clinical examination of the limb is necessary with emphasis on the degree of soft tissue damage. Blunt trauma in the lower limb is associated with a higher risk of early amputation. Polytrauma patients with complex limb injuries require a holistic approach, with Damage Control Orthopedics (DCO) principles. Traumatic bleeding significantly increases mortality rates, necessitating prompt control using pressure bandages or tourniquets. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is necessary in order to assess the viability of the limb.Management: Scoring systems can be used as a tool in the management of complex lower and upper limb injuries. Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) calculates ischemia, shock, bone and soft tissue damage, and patient characteristics. The Narakawa Index (NISSSA score) constitutes an alteration of MESS with the implementation of a nerve injury element. The Musculoskeletal Score for Severity of Injury (MESI score) estimates the risk of limb amputation by evaluating injury, neurovascular damage, type of fracture, patient characteristics, and the period from the occurrence of trauma to the definitive treatment. Further interventions and patient preferences should be incorporated into the decision-making process.Outcome: The outcomes of limb salvage versus amputation for complex limb injuries encompass various factors, including patient's preinjury health status, psychological well-being, functional outcomes, and economic impact. While some studies suggest better psychological outcomes with limb reconstruction and others find similar functional outcomes between the two approaches, economic considerations play a significant role in decision-making.Conclusion: Managing complex limb injuries effectively necessitates a comprehensive approach involving thorough assessment, multidisciplinary collaboration, and patient-centered care. Given the diverse factors influencing management and long-term outcomes, it is crucial to integrate medical expertise with patient preferences and expectations.",ADVANCES IN ORTHOPEDICS,2025,"Serlis, A; Sgardelis, P; Vampertzis, T; Rizavas, K; Poulios, P; Konstantopoulos, G",10.1155/aort/2884802,,WOS:001408935200001,A

Methods: This retrospective descriptive study utilized a convenience sample of emergency dispatch data collected from 23 Emergency Communication Centers (ECCs) spanning 14 states across the United States (U.S.) from July 11, 2014 to August 13, 2018, including all cases in which the EMD recorded any response to the AED availability prompt. Data were collected using ProQA, the software version of the Medical Priority Dispatch System. Primary outcome measures were (a) distribution of responses to the AED prompt; (b) percentage of cases in which an AED was retrieved; and (c) percentage of cases in which AED pads were placed by the bystander-caller. Results: A total of 2,200,285 cases were collected during the study period, in 18,904 (0.86%) of which the AED prompt was displayed (indicating suspected out of hospital cardiac arrest, or OHCA). Overall, an AED was reported as available 5.8% (n = 1,091) of the time the EMD recorded an answer to the AED prompt. In multiple-rescuer situations, a rescuer was sent to get the AED 2.8% (n = 523) of the time, as opposed to only 0.30% (n = 56) for single-rescuer calls. The AED was reported to be already on scene, by the patient, in 2.7% (n = 512) of the cases. A majority (72.0%; n = 417) of the time, rescuers who were sent to get an AED were unable to retrieve it, with single rescuers being successful more often (57.1% unable to retrieve, vs 73.6% for multiple rescuers). Conclusions: AEDs are reported as available by only a small percentage of callers to 911, and in the majority of cases in which a bystander rescuer is sent to retrieve an AED, one is never located or used. Sending someone to retrieve the AED may be more appropriate in multiple-rescuer situations than when a single bystander rescuer is alone on scene.",PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE,2019,"Gardett, I; Broadbent, M; Scott, G; Clawson, JJ; Olola, C",10.1080/10903127.2018.1559565,,WOS:000509907800010,A

However, it has also been critiqued for its focus on traits (e.g. well-defined system boundaries) that are increasingly threatened by social and environmental trends. Fisheries are a key example of this challenge. While small-scale fisheries are critically important to the diets and livelihoods of millions, industrial fisheries from developed countries now dominate fishing around the world. While these two systems are governed separately, there is substantial overlap between them, conceptualized as the growing influence of globalization on local common pool resource (CPR) systems. One of the most impactful, but least understood consequences of this convergence are the emerging conflicts and competition between small-scale and industrial fisheries. In these systems, the interaction between small-scale CPRs and globalized commodity chains has meant the creation of a new, hybrid resource system, addressed by neither conventional industrial nor traditional small-scale governance approaches. We use empirical data from 396 cases of interactions at sea between globalized industrial and local small-scale fishers in Ghana from 1984 to 2013 to examine the conditions under which resource users conflict or cooperate, linking them to broader political and economic dynamics across scales. We consider the institutional factors that mediate these interactions, identifying policies to promote cooperative, and avert conflictual incidents. We further consider the long-term effects of these patterns of conflict and cooperation for the resilience or vulnerability of the resource base, the fishers, and the institutions governing the system. We suggest that specific governance arrangements that reduce disparities between groups, promote bridging social capital, and enhance hybrid and cross-scale institutions offer the best potential to govern resource systems where traditional CPRs and market-oriented industries converge.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,2023,"Seto, KL; Aheto, DW; Kwadjosse, T; O'Neill, K",10.1088/1748-9326/acdca8,,WOS:001025362600001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,NEO-SAFE: a clinical model for patients and healthcare personnel safety in primary level hospitals,"Patient safety is a major concern in medicine. Approximately, 4 million infants die each year worldwide and 23% of these deaths are caused by perinatal asphyxia. To prevent the long-term damage of asphyxia, the resuscitation flowchart must be perfectly and promptly performed. However, high effectiveness in performing resuscitation can only be achieved and maintained if the algorithm is frequently executed. Therefore, maintaining a high level of patient care is difficult in some remote centres. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new organizational model of care-network between Hub & Spoke hospitals to improve both the safety of the newborns in hospitals with a low number of births and the well-being of operators. Our project, NEO-SAFE (NEOnatal SAFety and training Elba), began in 2017 and involved the neonatal intensive care unit and the NINA Center of the Pisa University Hospital (hub) and the Hospital of Elba Island (spoke). It consisted of a continuous training program, both with 'classic' training course and 'on-job tutoring' (on side and remotely), of the health workers at spoke (i.e. nurses, midwives, and paediatricians). All four milestones of the study design were achieved. During the project, NINA Center instructors organized training courses for the staff in Portoferraio. These courses were based on learning technical and non-technical skills in a training course of increasing difficulty. Staff training needs were also monitored during the project by means of periodic questionnaires, sentinel events, and specific requests. The curve described by the rate of newborns transfer to the Pisa neonatal intensive care unit (hub) shows a monotonous decreasing trend line. On the other hand, this project allowed operators to develop greater self-confidence and greater safety in managing emergency situations, reducing stress for them and improving patient safety. The project allowed the creation of a safe, effective, low-cost, and reproducible organizational model for centres with a low number of births.

This study examines the prognostic significance of ambulatory brachial BP, central BP, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and heart rate-adjusted augmentation index [AIx(75)] in this population. A total of 170 hemodialysis patients underwent 48-hour ambulatory monitoring with Mobil-O-Graph-NG during a standard interdialytic interval and followed-up for 28.1 +/- 11.2 months. The primary end point was a combination of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. Secondary end points included: (1) all-cause mortality; (2) cardiovascular mortality; and (3) a combination of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitation after cardiac arrest, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. During follow-up, 37(21.8%) patients died and 46(27.1%) had cardiovascular events. Cumulative freedom from primary end point was similar for quartiles of predialysis-systolic BP (SBP), 48-hour peripheral-SBP, and central-SBP, but was progressively longer for increasing quartiles for 48-hour peripheral-diastolic BP and central-diastolic BP and shorter for increasing quartiles of 48-hour central pulse pressure (83.7%, 71.4%, 69.0%, 62.8% [log-rank P=0.024]), PWV (93.0%, 81.0%, 57.1%, 55.8% [log-rank P< 0.001]), and AIx(75) (88.4%, 66.7%, 69.0%, 62.8% [log-rank P=0.014]). The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and the combined outcome were similar for quartiles of predialysis-SBP, 48-hour peripheral-SBP, and central-SBP, but were increasing with higher ambulatory PWV and AIx(75). In multivariate analysis, 48-hour PWV was the only vascular parameter independently associated with the primary end point (hazard ratios, 1.579; 95% confidence intervals, 1.187-2.102). Ambulatory PWV, AIx(75), and central pulse pressure are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, whereas office and ambulatory SBP are not.

It may prevent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening, an event which plays a pivotal role in ischemia-reperfusion injury. PTP is the main end-effector of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) signaling pathway. We hypothesized that therapeutic hypothermia activates the RISK pathway, thereby preventing PTP opening and its deleterious neurological consequences after CA. Four groups of New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 15 min of CA and 120 min of reperfusion: Control, HT (hypothermia at 32 degrees-34 degrees C), NIM (specific PTP inhibition with N-methyl-4-isoleucine-cyclosporine at the onset of reperfusion), and HT+NIM. A Sham group only underwent surgery. The following measurements were taken: pupillary reflexes and brain damage biomarkers (NSE and S100 beta), RISK pathway activation in brain cortex (total and phosphorylated forms of both protein kinase B [Akt] and extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]) and PTP opening in isolated brain mitochondria. Therapeutic hypothermia and pharmacological PTP inhibition preserved the pupillary reflexes and prevented the increase in both NSE and S100 beta (P < 0.05 vs. controls). These two interventions also enhanced (P < 0.05 vs. controls) the phospho-Akt/Akt ratio to a similar extent while preventing a CA-induced increase in phospho-ERK/ERK ratio. This Akt activation in the HT and NIM groups was associated with an attenuation of CA-induced PTP opening. In this model, therapeutic hypothermia promoted the activation of the RISK signaling pathway via Akt and limited CA-induced brain injury by preventing PTP opening.",SHOCK,2019,"Jahandiez, V; Cour, M; Abrial, M; Loufouat, J; Ovize, M; Argaud, L",10.1097/SHK.0000000000001234,,WOS:000480798900012,A

The primary meeting objective was to generate preliminary suggestions for a series of follow-up meetings that will develop consensus guidelines for the design of large multicenter clinical trials. Twenty short presentations and discussions, summarized here, outlined the group's concerns and suggestions. Successful and failed, completed or ongoing, clinical studies provided insight as to endpoints that may be of value for future trauma and shock studies. In addition to the importance of appropriate endpoints in study design, other related topics were discussed, including trauma epidemiology, patient enrollment and inclusion criteria, community consultation and the difficulty of obtaining informed consent in acute trauma research, and the inclusion of quality of life in composite endpoints.

Over the past few years, there have been several important prospective clinical trials comparing rate control with rhythm control in patients with recurrent AF. The Pharmacological Intervention in Atrial Fibrillation (PIAF) trial was the first prospective randomized study to test the hypothesis of equivalency between the 2 management strategies for AF. The trial demonstrated that rate control was not inferior to rhythm control with respect to symptoms, quality of life, or number of hospitalizations in patients with persistent AF. The Strategies of Treatment in Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) trial was a pilot study that enrolled approximately 200 patients with AF who were randomized to either ventricular rate control or cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. The results, showed that over a 1-year period there was little difference in outcome in terms of morbidity or symptoms. In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, patients with AF and risk factors for stroke were randomized to either rhythm control or, rate control, with both groups receiving anticoagulation with warfarin. There was no difference in the composite end point of death, disabling stroke or anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest between the 2 arms. In addition, no major differences were noted in functional status or quality of life. The Rate Control Versus Electrical Cardioversion (RACE) trial also reached a similar conclusion. Thus, rate control is an acceptable primary strategy for management of patients with recurrent AF.

This is in the face of the rising cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest contributed largely to the high incidence of road traffic accidents. Non-communicable diseases are also on the rise further increasing the incidence of cardiac arrest. Medical students are key players in the bid to strengthen the health system which warrants an assessment of their knowledge and attitude towards BLS inclusion in their study curriculum. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 among undergraduate medical students across eight public and private universities in Uganda. An online-based questionnaire was developed using Google forms and distributed via identified WhatsApp groups. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test and logistic regression were performed in STATA 15 to assess the association between knowledge of BLS and demographics.

Patients may have had a cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmias, whereas partners may have to perform CPR and manage the ongoing challenges of heart disease therapy. Currently, support for post-ICD care focuses primarily on restoring patient functioning with few interventions available to partners who serve as primary support. This descriptive study examined and compared patterns of change for both patients and partners during the first year post-ICD implantation. For this longitudinal study, the sample included 42 of 55 (76.4 %) patient-partner dyads who participated in the 'usual care' group of a larger intervention RCT with patients following ICD implant for secondary prevention of cardiac arrest. Measures taken at across five time points (at hospital discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up) tracked physical function (SF-12 PCS, symptoms); psychological adjustment (SF-12 MCS; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; CES-D); relationship impact (Family Functioning, DOII; Mutuality and Interpersonal Sensitivity, MIS); and healthcare utilization (ED visits, outpatient visits, hospitalizations). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to characterize and compare outcome trends for patients and partners across the first 12 months of recovery. Patients were 66.5 +/- 11.3 (mean + SD) years old, predominately Caucasian male (91 %), with Charlson comorbidities of 4.4 +/- 2.4. Partners were 62.5 +/- 11.1 years old, predominantly female (91 %) with Charlson co-morbidities of 2.9 +/- 3.0. Patient versus partner differences were observed in the pattern of physical health (F = 10.8, p < 0.0001); patient physical health improved while partner health showed few changes. For partners compared to patients, anxiety, depression, and illness demands on family functioning tended to be higher. Patient mutuality was stable, while partner mutuality increased steadily (F = 2.5, p = 0.05). Patient sensitivity was highest at discharge and declined; partner sensitivity increased (F = 10.2, p < 0.0001) across the 12-month recovery. Outpatient visits for patients versus partners differed (F = 5.0, p = 0.008) due most likely to the number of required patient ICD visits.

In each pair of the strains compared, the strains differed in terms of (i) growth-related, physiological, and biochemical properties; (ii) resistance to stress factors; (iii) capacity for generation of dormant forms (DFs) under growth arrest conditions, and (iv) intrapopulation production of phase variants. The strains isolated from permafrost displayed a lower growth rate but were more resistant to repeated freezing-thawing treatment than the collection strains. Under the same growth conditions, the permafrost strains formed larger numbers of cystlike anabiotic DFs, extraordinarily small cells, and forms that became nonculturable during long-term storage. Resuscitation of the nonculturable forms resulted in a 2- to-7-fold increase in the percentage of FISH-detectable metabolically active cells. The permafrost strains were also distinguished by increased genome lability. This facilitated their dissociation into intrapopulation variants with phenotypically distinct colonial and morphological properties and different antibiotic resistance. The phenotypic variability was more prominent in Arthrobacter (for which it was not reported previously) than in Acinetobacter. In the populations produced by plating the dormant bacterial forms, the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the phase variant spectra varied depending on the formation conditions and the composition of the solid media used for the plating.

Computed tomographic scans showed right-lobe or bilobar liver lacerations and/or subcapsular hematomas in all patients and associated hemoperitoneum in 8 patients. Exploration was required in 2 patients; both were found to have a hemoperitoneum and a nonbleeding liver laceration. There were no deaths. Patients with hemoperitoneum requiring transfusion had significantly greater injury severely and longer intensive care unit and hospital stays. The major advantage of a nonoperative approach is the oppertunity to stabilize major extra-abdomina (particularly head) injuries as the first priority.

This type of lesion becomes especially critical when the gluteal muscles and/or the hamstrings are affected as they usually offer a cushioning effect to protect from skin injuries. Previous research conducted over the past 30 years has made advancements in the development of parameters for the optimal application of long pulse stimulation with the aim to restore muscle structure and trophic aspects in people with chronic SCI (<20 years post-injury). This work provides an overview of previous achievements in the field through a narrative literature review before presenting preliminary results in the form of a case series from an ongoing study investigating the acute effects of six months of long pulse stimulation on the tissue composition of the gluteal muscles in five people with chronic SCI (>20 years post-injury). Participants underwent a 33-min home-based long pulse stimulation program five times a week, and their muscle and adipose tissue thicknesses were assessed at baseline, after three and six months, respectively, using magnetic resonance imaging. The results show that the largest increase in muscle thickness occurred at the level of the height of the acetabulum (+44.37%; chi(2)(2) = 0.5; p = 0.779), whereas the most important decrease in adipose tissue occurred at the level of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) reference (-11.43%; chi(2)(2) = 1.6; p = 0.449) within only six months of regular stimulation despite the preceding long denervation period.

Better protective antigens for TB-vaccines are urgently needed, also in view of the disappointing results of the MVA85 vaccine, which failed to induce additional protection in BCG-vaccinated infants (1). Moreover, immune responses to relevant antigens may be useful to identify TB-specific biomarker signatures. Here, we describe the potency of novel tools and strategies to reveal such Mtb antigens. Using proteins specific for different Mtb infection phases, many new antigens of the latency-associated Mtb DosR-regulon as well as resuscitation promoting factor proteins, associated with resuscitating TB, were discovered that were recognized by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells. Furthermore, by employing MHC binding algorithms and bioinformatics combined with high-throughput human T-cell screens and tetramers, HLA-class la restricted polyfunctional CD8+ T-cells were identified in TB patients. Comparable methods, led to the identification of HLA-E-restricted Mtb epitopes recognized by CD8+ T-cells. A genome-wide unbiased antigen discovery approach was applied to analyze the in vivo Mtb gene expression profiles in the lungs of mice, resulting in the identification of IVE-TB antigens, which are expressed during infection in the lung, the main target organ of Mtb. IVE-TB antigens induce strong T-cell responses in long-term latently Mtb infected individuals, and represent an interesting new group of TB antigens for vaccination. In summary, new tools have helped expand our view on the Mtb antigenome involved in human cellular immunity and provided new candidates for TB vaccination.",FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY,2014,"Geluk, A; van Meijgaarden, KE; Joosten, SA; Commandeur, S; Ottenhoff, THM",10.3389/fimmu.2014.00256,,WOS:000354285000001,A

An International Perspective,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) remains a challenge in terms of diagnosis and classification, its morbidity and mortality remaining high in the face of improving clinical protocols. Current clinical criteria use serum creatinine (sCr) and urine output to classify patients. Ongoing research has identified novel biomarkers that may improve the speed and accuracy of patient evaluation and prognostication, yet the route from basic science to clinical practice remains poorly paved. International evidence supporting the use of plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a valuable biomarker of AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) for a number of clinical scenarios was presented at the 31st International Vicenza Course on Critical Care Nephrology, and these data are detailed in this review. NGAL was shown to be highly useful alongside sCr, urinary output, and other biomarkers in assessing kidney injury; in patient stratification and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) selection in paediatric AKI; in assessing kidney injury in conjunction with sCr in sepsis; in guiding resuscitation protocols in conjunction with brain natriuretic peptide in burn patients; as an early biomarker of delayed graft function and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity in kidney transplantation from extended criteria donors; as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease and heart failure, and in guiding CRRT selection in the intensive care unit and emergency department. While some applications require further clarification by way of larger randomised controlled trials, NGAL nevertheless demonstrates promise as an independent biological marker with the potential to improve earlier diagnosis and better assessment of risk groups in AKI and CKD.

A recent therapeutic approach to patients with ADHF includes combination therapy with hypertonic saline solution (HSS) and furosemide, based on the hypothesis that resistance to loop diuretics occurs because of achievement of plateau in water and sodium excretion in patients receiving long-term loop diuretic therapy. Objective Our aim was to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficiency of combination HSS plus furosemide therapy in patients with ADHF in terms of mortality, readmissions, length of hospital stay, kidney function, urine output, body weight, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Methods A total of 14 studies-four observational and ten randomized studies (total 3398 patients)-were included in the meta-analysis. Results Our results demonstrate the superiority of combination HSS plus furosemide therapy over furosemide alone in terms of kidney function preservation (mean creatinine difference - 0.33 mg/dL; P < 0.00001), improved diuresis (mean difference [MD] 581.94 mL/24 h; P < 0.00001) and natriuresis (MD 57.19; P < 0.00001), weight loss (MD 0.99 kg; P < 0.00001), duration of hospital stay (MD - 2.72 days; P < 0.00001), readmissions (relative risk 0.63; P = 0.01), and mortality (relative risk 0.55; P < 0.00001).

Accurate assessment, appropriate intervention and apt clinical skills are needed for proper management from time of presentation to discharge. The advent of pharmacologic acid suppression, endoscopic hemostatic techniques, and recognition of Helicobacter pylori as an etiologic agent in peptic ulcer disease (PUD) has revolutionized the treatment of UGIH. Despite this, acute UGIH still carries considerable rates of morbidity and mortality. This review aims to discuss current areas of uncertainty and controversy in the management of UGIH. Neoadjuvant proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has become standard empiric treatment for UGIH given that PUD is the leading cause of non-variceal UGIH, and PPIs are extremely effective at promoting ulcer healing. However, neoadjuvant PPI administration has not been shown to affect hard clinical outcomes such as rebleeding or mortality. The optimal timing of upper endoscopy in UGIH is often debated. Upon completion of volume resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization, upper endoscopy should be performed within 24 h in all patients with evidence of UGIH for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. With rising healthcare cost paramount in today's medical landscape, the ability to appropriately triage UGIH patients is of increasing value. Upper endoscopy in conjunction with the clinical scenario allows for accurate decision making concerning early discharge home in low-risk lesions or admission for further monitoring and treatment in higher-risk lesions. Concomitant pharmacotherapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antiplatelet agents, such as clopidogrel, has a major impact on the etiology, severity, and potential treatment of UGIH. Long-term PPI use in patients taking chronic NSAIDs or clopidogrel is discussed thoroughly in this review. (C) 2012 Baishideng.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,EMPOWERING END-OF-LIFE CONVERSATIONS: The Role of Specialized Nursing Teams in Facilitating Code Status Changes at Discharge,"Objectives: Hospitalized patients may require goals of care (GOC) or Advance Health Care Planning (ACP), which can be time-consuming and emotionally tolling for providers. A nursing team specializing in code status (CODE), GOC, and ACP was developed to provide meaningful support for patients and families and decrease provider burden. Interest in CODE, GOC, ACP, and effectiveness of a nursing team to lead these conversations prompted this study. Methods: A collaborative nursing team was trained to address CODE, GOC, and ACP with patients demonstrating illness or geriatric syndrome. This team conducted 3 visits per patient on average during hospitalization using structured CODE templates to establish longer term goals and document what matters in the healthcare journey. Comprehensive narratives for ACP and GOC were included in charting, syncing the medical team, nursing, patient, and family. Consults were tracked over nine months with data reviewed retrospectively from medical charts. Descriptive analyses of cohort demographics, CODE and outcomes were completed. Results: The study group comprised 3342 patients between October 2022 and June 2023. Patients ranged in age from 18-106 years, with majority (88%) age 65 years and older. Mean length of stay (LOS) was 6.8 days with CODE documented for 91% upon admission. Of the 3166 older adults with known CODE on admission, 946 (30%) changed CODE by discharge, of which 95% were de-escalated. 83% of older patients arriving with limited CODE maintained limitations at discharge, with a small portion converting to comfort (16%). Conclusion: Employing a focused nursing team to conduct CODE, GOC, and ACP conversations may be an effective use of time and resources and result in de-escalation of resuscitation orders for patients demonstrating illness or geriatric syndrome.",JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE CARE,2025,"Wintz, D; Schaffer, KB; Wright, K; Nilsen, SL",10.1177/08258597241283303,,WOS:001316179400001,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Lateral fluid percussion brain injury: A 15-year review and evaluation,"This article comprehensively reviews the lateral fluid percussion (LFP) model of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in small animal species with particular emphasis on its validity, clinical relevance and reliability. The UP model, initially described in 1989, has become the most extensively utilized animal model of TBI (to date, 232 PubMed citations), producing both focal and diffuse (mixed) brain injury. Despite subtle variations in injury parameters between laboratories, universal findings are evident across studies, including histological, physiological, metabolic, and behavioral changes that serve to increase the reliability of the model. Moreover, demonstrable histological damage and severity-dependent behavioral deficits, which partially recover over time, validate LFP as a clinically-relevant model of human TBI. The UP model, also has been used extensively to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions, including resuscitation, pharmacologic therapies, transplantation, and other neuroprotective and neuroregenerative strategies. Although a number of positive studies have identified promising therapies for moderate TBI, the predictive validity of the model may be compromised when findings are translated to severely injured patients. Recently, the clinical relevance of LFP has been enhanced by combining the injury with secondary insults, as well as broadening studies to incorporate issues of gender and age to better approximate the range of human TBI within study design. We conclude that the LFP brain injury model is an appropriate tool to study the cellular and mechanistic aspects of human TBI that cannot be addressed in the clinical setting, as well as for the development and characterization of novel therapeutic interventions. Continued translation of pre-clinical findings to human TBI will enhance the predictive validity of the LFP model, and allow novel neuroprotective and neuroregenerative treatment strategies developed in the laboratory to reach the appropriate TBI patients.",JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA,2005,"Thompson, HJ; Lifshitz, J; Marklund, N; Grady, MS; Graham, DI; Hovda, DA; McIntosh, TK",10.1089/neu.2005.22.42,,WOS:000226451600003,A

In the past few years, other gaseous molecules have been introduced in clinical practice to treat the wide variety of physiological derangement seen in critical care patients. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is used for its unique selective pulmonary vasodilator effect. Recent studies showed that NO plays a pivotal role in regulating ischemia-reperfusion injury and it has antibacterial and antiviral activity. Helium, due to its low density, is used in patients with upper airway obstruction and lower airway obstruction to facilitate gas flow and to reduce work of breathing. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous gas that acts as a signaling molecule involved in many biologic pathways. CO's anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects are under investigation in the setting of acute respiratory distress and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Inhaled anesthetics are widely used in the operative room setting and, with the development of anesthetic reflectors, are now a valid option for sedation management in the intensive care unit. Many other gases such as xenon, argon, and hydrogen sulfide are under investigation for their neuroprotective and cardioprotective effects in post-cardiac arrest syndrome. With all these therapeutic options available, the clinician must have a clear understanding of the physiologic basis, therapeutic potential, and possible adverse events of these therapeutic gases.

The usual therapeutic strategy in survivors starts with drug treatment, in case of failure followed by nonpharmacological therapy, which may include catheter ablation, ablative surgery, and finally defibrillator implantation. In most cases, this strategy is long lasting and very expensive. Implantation of a defibrillator as a first choice therapy may be cost effective, especially if the probability of successful drug treatment is low. However, cost-effective aspects have been studied only retrospectively and in models. In 1989 we started a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of implantation of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) as first choice therapy (''early'' AICD implantation) in successfully resuscitated postinfarct patients. Evaluation is being done in a randomized way with one group having early AICD implantation and the other group following the usual conventional therapeutic strategy.

We collected evidence by conducting systematic literature retrieval and using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.Results: This guideline made twenty-five recommendations that covered the diagnosis, preparation, emergency treatment, and post-emergency management of anaphylaxis. We recommended the use of a set of adapted diagnostic criteria from the American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN), and developed a severity grading system that classified anaphylaxis into four grades.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Standards for Studies of Neurological Prognostication in Comatose Survivors of Cardiac Arrest: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association,"Significant improvements have been achieved in cardiac arrest resuscitation and postarrest resuscitation care, but mortality remains high. Most of the poor outcomes and deaths of cardiac arrest survivors have been attributed to widespread brain injury. This brain injury, commonly manifested as a comatose state, is a marker of poor outcome and a major basis for unfavorable neurological prognostication. Accurate prognostication is important to avoid pursuing futile treatments when poor outcome is inevitable but also to avoid an inappropriate withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment in patients who may otherwise have a chance of achieving meaningful neurological recovery. Inaccurate neurological prognostication leading to withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and deaths may significantly bias clinical studies, leading to failure in detecting the true study outcomes. The American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science Subcommittee organized a writing group composed of adult and pediatric experts from neurology, cardiology, emergency medicine, intensive care medicine, and nursing to review existing neurological prognostication studies, the practice of neurological prognostication, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. The writing group determined that the overall quality of existing neurological prognostication studies is low. As a consequence, the degree of confidence in the predictors and the subsequent outcomes is also low. Therefore, the writing group suggests that neurological prognostication parameters need to be approached as index tests based on relevant neurological functions that are directly related to the functional outcome and contribute to the quality of life of cardiac arrest survivors.

Unfortunately, large randomized trials, which have unequivocally demonstrated benefits of urgent percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes, systematically excluded patients with preceding cardiac arrest followed by successful reestablishment of spontaneous circulation. There are several nonrandomized trials in patients with electrocardiographic signs of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction after reestablishment of spontaneous circulation which together accumulated 478 patients. After urgent coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 98%. Patency of infarct-related artery was reestablished in 89%. Success of primary percutaneous coronary intervention and hospital survival in patients regaining consciousness soon after reestablishment of spontaneous circulation appeared to be comparable with ST-elevation myocardial infarction population without preceding cardiac arrest. This is in contrast with comatose survivors of cardiac arrest in whom survival to hospital discharge was, despite somewhat smaller patency of infarct-related artery after percutaneous coronary intervention (94% vs. 82%; p = .12), disproportionably decreased to 57% with good neurologic outcome in only 38%.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Decompressive craniectomy in the treatment of post-traumatic intracranial hypertension in children: our philosophy and indications,"Decompressive craniotomy (DC) in children is a life-saving procedure for the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension related to traumatic, ischemic and infectious lesions. Different surgical procedures have been proposed including uni or bilateral hemicraniectomy, bi-frontal, bi-temporal, or bi-parietal craniotomies. DC can avoid the cascade of events related to tissue hypoxia, brain perfusion reduction, hypotension and the evolution of brain edema that can be responsible for brain herniation. The monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) is very important to take a decision as well as the value of Trans cranial Doppler (TCD). Repeated TCD in the intensive care unit give important information about the decrease of the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and facilitates the decision making. The important question is about how long time we have to wait before to perform the DC. Three conditions can be distinguished: 1) ICP stable and TCD with good parameters: the decision can be postponed; 2) ICP>20 mmHg with good TCD and without clinical signs of deterioration: the decision can be postponed; 3) ICP>20 mmHg with altered CPP and degraded TCD value and clinical signs of brain herniation: the surgical procedure is indicated. The decision of a ventricular drainage can also be discussed but in cases of slit ventricles it is preferable to realize a DC to avoid the problems of multiple taps without finding the ventricular system. In some very specific situations, DC has to be contraindicated. The first one is a prolonged cardiopulmonary arrest with a no-flow longer than 15 minutes and irreversible lesions on the TCD or on the CT-scan. The second most common situation is a patient with GCS of 3 on admission associated with bilaterally fixed dilated pupils. In this case TCD is very useful to document the decrease or the absence of diastolic flux that indicates a very poor cerebral perfusion. In case of severe poly traumatism with multiorgan failure, especially in very severe hemorrhagic shock with incontrollable coagulopathy, the realization of DC is definitely hazardous with y a high risk of cardiac arrest during the surgical procedure. The decision to realize a hemicraniectomy or a bi-frontal craniotomy is related to the presence or not of associated traumatic lesions as hemorrhagic contusions or a sub-dural or extradural hematoma. In cases of diffuse cerebral edema the bi-frontal bone flap is indicated. In all cases a closure of the dura mater with a large dural patch has to be performed avoiding compression of the nervous system. Our results showed a mortality rate of 18%.

Groups of newborns at higher risk for AKI include those with perinatal hypoxia, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), premature and very low birth weight infants, and newborns with sepsis. AKI is associated with poor short-term and long-term outcomes and has a multifactorial aetiology.Aim: To evaluate the aetiological profile and short-term outcomes of AKI in neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort (descriptive) study was conducted in the NICU at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital, Guwahati, Assam, India, over a period of one year, from September 1, 2021, to August 31, 2022. A total of 100 neonates exhibiting signs and symptoms of AKI according to Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Detailed neonatal history, including neonatal resuscitation, history of perinatal asphyxia, signs and symptoms of sepsis, Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), or any other symptoms, were recorded. The course and outcome of the neonates during their NICU stay were noted. Data were presented in terms of frequency (n) and percentages (%). Results: Among the 100 AKI neonates, 58 were males and 42 were females, with a male-to-female ratio of 1.38:1. Out of 100 neonates, birth asphyxia constituted 40 (40%) cases, of cases, followed by sepsis in 30 (30%), RDS 27 (27%), dehydration 2 (2%), and obstructive uropathy in 1 (1%) case. Among the 100 AKI neonates, 64 (64%) cases were discharged, 35 (35%) expired, and 1 (1%) were transferred to the paediatric surgery department.Conclusion: Neonatal AKI is an independent contributor to morbidity and mortality.

While prior studies describe the clinical presentation of patients requiring paramedic out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation (ETI), limited data characterize the underlying medical conditions or comorbidities. Objective. To characterize the medical conditions and comorbidities of patients receiving successful paramedic out-of-hospital ETI. Methods. We used Pennsylvania statewide emergency medical services (EMS) clinical data, including all successful ETIs performed during 2003--2005. Using multiple imputation triple-match algorithms, we probabilistically linked EMS ETI to statewide death and hospital admission data. Each hospitalization record contained one primary and up to eight secondary diagnoses, classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). We determined the proportion of patients in each major ICD-9-CM diagnostic group and subgroup. We calculated the Charlson Comorbidity Index score for each patient. Using binomial proportions with confidence intervals (CIs), we analyzed the data and combined imputed results using Rubin's method. Results. Across the imputed sets, we linked 25,733 (77.7%% linkage) successful ETIs to death or hospital records; 56.3%% patients died before and 43.7%% survived to hospital admission. Of the 14,478 patients who died before hospital admission, most (92.7%%; 95%% CI: 92.5--93.3%%) had presented to EMS in cardiac arrest. Of the 11,255 hospitalized patents, the leading primary diagnoses were circulatory diseases (32.0%%; 95%% CI: 30.2--33.7%%), respiratory diseases (22.8%%; 95%% CI: 21.9--23.7%%), and injury or poisoning (25.2%%; 95%% CI: 22.7--27.8%%). Prominent primary diagnosis subgroups included asphyxia and respiratory failure (15.2%%), traumatic brain injury and skull fractures (11.3%%), acute myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease (10.9%%), poisonings and drug and alcohol disorders (6.7%%), dysrhythmias (6.7%%), hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic stroke (5.9%%), acute heart failure and cardiomyopathies (5.6%%), pneumonia and aspiration (4.9%%), and sepsis, septicemia, and septic shock (3.2%%). Most of the admitted ETI patients had a secondary circulatory (70.8%%), respiratory (61.4%%), or endocrine, nutritional, or metabolic (51.4%%) secondary diagnosis. The mean Charlson Index score was 1.6 (95%% CI: 1.5--1.7). Conclusions. The majority of successful paramedic ETIs occur on patients with cardiac arrest and circulatory and respiratory conditions. Injuries, poisonings, and other conditions compromise smaller but important portions of the paramedic ETI pool. Patients undergoing ETI have multiple comorbidities.

In the years since, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the International Liaison Committee for Resuscitation (ILCOR) have promoted AED technology for use in hospitals as well, resulting in the widespread purchase and use of AED-capable defibrillators. In-hospital use of AEDs now appears to have decreased survival from cardiac arrests. This article will look at the use of AEDs in hospitals as a case of ""medical reversal."" Medical reversal occurs when an accepted, widely used treatment is found to be ineffective or even harmful. This article will discuss the issue of AEDs in the hospital using a conceptual framework provided by recent work on medical reversal.

Microbiological and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis caused by Acinetobacter baumanii. A broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was administered and later readjusted according to the results of microbiological culture. Intensive hemodynamic support was required. Wounds were dressed daily with a 3 percent boric acid solution and a silver sulfadiazine-impregnated dressing. An extensive surgical debridement was promptly performed and repeated until complete control of the infection. Wounds were finally covered with split-thickness skin grafts. The infection was overcome 35 days after admission. The graft take was 100%. Postoperative rehabilitation was required because of the functional limitation of lower limb movements. Follow-up at 6 months showed no functional deficit and an acceptable aesthetic result.

However, prognosis and risk factors of survivors upon hospital admission after traumatic cardiac arrest remain unclear. We aimed to describe the outcomes, identify risk factors, and develop a simple risk-scoring model for patients resuscitated from traumatic cardiac arrest.METHODSThis observational multicenter study analyzed data from the Japan Trauma Data Bank from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021. Patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the emergency department and survived to the day after hospital admission for traumatic cardiac arrest were included. Factors associated with survival to hospital discharge were determined using mixed-effects multivariable logistic regression analysis. A simple scoring model was developed to stratify the probability of survival to hospital discharge.RESULTSIn total, 452 patients from 119 hospitals (median age, 64 years; 334 [74.4%] men) were included in the analysis. Of these, 130 (28.8%) survived until discharge. Penetrating injury, signs of life upon hospital arrival, and Injury Severity Score were significantly associated with survival at hospital discharge. A scoring model that assigned 1 point each for penetrating injury and signs of life upon hospital arrival effectively stratified the probability of survival to hospital discharge, with scores of 0, 1, and 2 corresponding to survival probabilities of 12.2%, 35.2%, and 83.3%, respectively.CONCLUSIONThis study described the outcomes and risk factors of patients resuscitated from traumatic cardiac arrest.

The Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS) is a brief, self-reported instrument designed to screen for insomnia. This study aimed to identify the measurement properties of the MISS in CA survivors and to explore a relevant cut-off score. Methods: Data were collected from two studies: a health survey of CA survivors and a sub-study of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on targeted temperature management (TTM2). A total of 269 CA survivors participated, with 212 from the survey and 57 from the RCT, the data was collected 6- 7 months after CA. The MISS was evaluated using the polytomous Rasch model, focusing on model fit, local independence, response category functioning, targeting, reliability, and differential item functioning (DIF). Results: In total, 212 participants were males and 57 females, with a mean age of 66 years. Overall, 51% had survived in-hospital CA and 49% outof-hospital CA. The MISS exhibited acceptable model fit and targeting, with no disordered thresholds or DIF for age, sex, or place of arrest. The reliability was acceptable.

Many studies focus on survival, but few explore the outcomes. The aim of this study is to analyze the survival curve, independence, quality of life, and performance status after CA. Methods: This retrospective study included adults admitted to the intensive care unit of Cova da Beira University Hospital Center after CA between 2015 and 2019. We analyzed patient records and applied a questionnaire including EuroQoL's EQ-5D-3L and ECOG performance status. Results: Ninety-seven patients were included (mean age 75.74 years). Thirty-one patients (32.0%) survived to hospital discharge. There was a significant loss of independence for activities of daily living, with 50.0% of those previously independent becoming dependent and 47.5% of those previously at home being institutionalized. Diabetes, female gender, and length of hospital stay were especially impactful on these findings. One year after CA, only 20.6% were alive and only 13.4% (65% of the one-year survivors) were independent. Nine patients answered our questionnaire. Mean EQ-5D quality of life index (0.528 +/- 0.297) and the most affected domains ('Pain/discomfort' and 'Anxiety/depression') were similar to the Portuguese population aged >30 years. However, 66.6% reported a decline in their quality of life. Lastly, seven respondents had a good performance status (ECOG 0-1). Conclusions: There was a significant loss of independence after CA. Moreover, despite the acceptable performance status and the quality of life results being similar to the general population, there was a perceived deterioration post-CA. Ultimately, we emphasize the need to improve care for these patients. (c) 2024 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

All patients were resuscitated from the intraoperative cardiac arrest, but six suffered such severe neurologic injury that they died in hospital. Of the eight survivors, only one exhibited sufficient neurologic recovery to allow independence in daily self-care. In view of the unexpected nature of the  cardiac arrests, as well as the ultimate severity of injury, these cases were analyzed in detail to determine whether there were recurring patterns of management that may have contributed to the occurrence or outcome of these anesthetic mishaps. Two patterns were identified. The first was the intraoperative use of sufficient sedation to produce a comfortable-appearing, sleep-like state in which there was no spontaneous verbalization. Cyanosis frequently heralded the onset of cardiac arrest in  patients exhibiting this degree of sedation, suggesting that unappreciated respiratory insufficiency may have played an important role. The second pattern appeared to be an inadequate appreciation of the interaction between sympathetic blockade during high spinal anesthesia and the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Prompt augmentation of central venous filling through the use of a potent .alpha.-agonist and positional change might have improved organ perfusion, shortened the duration of  cardiac arrest, and lessened the degree of neurologic damage.",ANESTHESIOLOGY,1988,"CAPLAN, RA; WARD, RJ; POSNER, K; CHENEY, FW",10.1097/00000542-198801000-00003,,WOS:A1988L597700003,A

Concomitantly, the valve was successfully retrieved toward the ascending aorta using the snare technique, resulting in immediate restoration of flow and successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Subsequently, a 29-mm balloon-expandable aortic bioprosthesis was uneventfully implanted. After TAVI, the patient had a remarkable clinical evolution and was discharged home at hospitalization day five without relevant electrocardiographic nor echocardiographic disturbances. At six-month follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a normofunctional aortic bioprosthesis with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Discussion Acute coronary occlusion is a rare and life-threating complication of TAVI that may be prevented with accurate procedure planning. Pre-procedural computed tomography angiography is essential for a comprehensive patient evaluation, allowing appropriate valve selection, a key factor for successful management. Self-expandable valve retrieval with snare technique can be an appropriate strategy for the management of this complication. This case highlights the importance of performing these procedures in highly experienced centres and with fully equipped catheterization laboratories to allow timely interventions when facing unexpected events.",EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS,2022,"Lopes, PM; Brito, JD; Teles, RC; Almeida, MS",10.1093/ehjcr/ytac469,,WOS:000904711100007,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Differential Mitochondrial Bioenergetics in Neurons and Astrocytes Following Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury and Hypothermia,"The close interaction between neurons and astrocytes has been extensively studied. However, the specific behavior of these cells after ischemia-reperfusion injury and hypothermia remains poorly characterized. A growing body of evidence suggests that mitochondria function and putative transference between neurons and astrocytes may play a fundamental role in adaptive and homeostatic responses after systemic insults such as cardiac arrest, which highlights the importance of a better understanding of how neurons and astrocytes behave individually in these settings. Brain injury is one of the most important challenges in post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and therapeutic hypothermia remains the single, gold standard treatment for neuroprotection after cardiac arrest. In our study, we modeled ischemia-reperfusion injury by using in vitro enhanced oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion (eOGD-R) and subsequent hypothermia (HPT) (31.5 degrees C) to cell lines of neurons (HT-22) and astrocytes (C8-D1A) with/without hypothermia. Using cell lysis (LDH; lactate dehydrogenase) as a measure of membrane integrity and cell viability, we found that neurons were more susceptible to eOGD-R when compared with astrocytes. However, they benefited significantly from HPT, while the HPT effect after eOGD-R on astrocytes was negligible. Similarly, eOGD-R caused a more significant reduction in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in neurons than astrocytes, and the ATP-enhancing effects from HPT were more prominent in neurons than astrocytes. In both neurons and astrocytes, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed higher ROS output following eOGD-R, with a non-significant trend of differential reduction observed in neurons. HPT after eOGD-R effectively downregulated ROS in both cells; however, the effect was significantly more effective in neurons. Lipid peroxidation was higher after eOGD-R in neurons, while in astrocytes, the increase was not statistically significant. Interestingly, HPT had similar effects on the reduction in lipoperoxidation after eOGD-R with both types of cells. While glutathione (GSH) levels were downregulated after eOGD-R in both cells, HPT enhanced GSH in astrocytes, but worsened GSH in neurons. In conclusion, neuron and astrocyte cultures respond differently to eOGD-R and eOGD-R + HTP treatments. Neurons showed higher sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion insults than astrocytes; however, they benefited more from HPT therapy. These data suggest that given the differential effects from HPT in neurons and astrocytes, future therapeutic developments could potentially enhance HPT outcomes by means of neuronal and astrocytic targeted therapies.",BIOMEDICINES,2024,"Miyara, SJ; Shinozaki, K; Hayashida, K; Shoaib, M; Choudhary, RC; Zafeiropoulos, S; Guevara, S; Kim, J; Molmenti, EP; Volpe, BT; Becker, LB",10.3390/biomedicines12081705,,WOS:001305887200001,A

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of a highly selected cohort of patients with LQTS managed with an observation -only (intentional nontreatment) strategy. METHODS The cohort was derived from a comprehensive retrospec- tive registry of patients with LQTS. Clinical phenotype and genotype data were collected via review of electronic health records. RESULTS Among 661 patients with LQTS, 55 (8.3%) asymptomatic patients (53% female; 16 age < 18 years) were managed with inten- tional nontherapy. Only preventative measures were advised. Mean age at diagnosis was 37.8 +/- 21.2 years. Mean QTc was 448 +/- 30 ms. None of the patients experienced an LQTS-triggered cardiac event over mean follow-up of 7.5 +/- 4.3 years. Compared to the largertreated cohort, this intentionally untreated cohort was less symp- tomatic, was older at diagnosis, and had lower resting QTc values ( P < .0001). CONCLUSION After careful clinical evaluation, risk assessment, and institution of precautionary measures, an observation -only strategy may be considered in a highly selected group of LQTS patients with a clinical pro fi le that includes asymptomatic status, older age at diagnosis, and QTc < 470 ms, with excellent outcomes and better quality of life than LQTS patients treated with beta- blocker.

Forty-seven were employed before ACD implantation. Their mean (.+-. standard deviation) age was 53 .+-. 11 years, 83% were men, 75% had coronary artery disease, 76% presented with cardiac arrest and 28% had concomitant cardiac surgery. The mean ejection fraction of these patients was 0.41 .+-. 0.15. At follow-up, 29 patients (62%) had resumed work at 11 .+-. 9 weeks after implantation. Those who returned to work were better educated (15 vs 11 years, p < 0.001) and less likely to have a history of prior myocardial infarction (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between patients who returned to work and those who did not in terms of age, sex, race, functional class, ejection fraction, extent of coronary artery disease, reason for ACD, or concomitant surgery. Multivariate analysis revealed that level of education was the single best predictor of reemployment status. The only other factors found to add significant predictive power in a stepwise analysis were extent of coronary artery disease and marital status. The model using these 3 variables had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 72%. It was concluded that (1) most patients employed before ACD implantation are able to return to work after the procedure, and (2) nonmedical factors play an important role in the resumption of work-related activities.

Although UPJO remains the main surgical category of antenatally detected hydronephrosis, there is a lack of a gold-standard test that predicts the need for pyeloplasty. Subjects and methods: We retrospectively reviewed infants with a positive antenatal history of hydronephrosis who were confirmed to have grade 3 or 4 hydronephrosis on postnatal RUS between 2010 and 2020. We compared postnatal CPR between surgical and control groups and tested the correlation between postnatal CPR and diuretic renogram.Results: A total of 79 and 136 kidneys were included in the surgical and control groups, respectively. Kidneys that were managed with pyeloplasty between January 2010 and July 2020 were included in the surgical group, while kidneys from patients with comparable traits who were managed conservatively comprised the control group. At a mean age of 18.9 weeks at presentation and a mean follow-up period of 48.99 months, the median postnatal CPR was significantly greater in the surgical group (3.62 vs. 0.98, p<0.001). A postnatal CPR of 1.68 had a sensitivity and specificity of 96.2% and 84.8%, respectively, in predicting the need for future pyeloplasty (area under the curve (AUC)=0.966). There was a positive and significant correlation between postnatal CPR and the half-life of the renogram (p=0.018) but not significant with the differential function (p=0.090).Conclusion: Diuretic renography has little capability for predicting future pyeloplasty.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Influence of Stress on Gas Sorption Behavior and Induced Swelling in Coal: Implications for Sustainable CO2 Geological Storage,"The influence of stress on gas sorption behavior and sorption-induced swelling in coal is critical for the success of CO2-enhanced coalbed methane recovery (CO2-ECBM) and geological carbon sequestration-a key strategy for mitigating climate change and promoting clean energy transitions. However, this influence remains insufficiently understood, largely due to experimental limitations (e.g., overreliance on powdered coal samples) and conflicting theoretical frameworks in existing studies. To address this gap, this study systematically investigates the effects of two distinct stress constraints-constant confining pressure and constant volume-on CO2 adsorption capacity, adsorption kinetics, and associated swelling deformation of intact anthracite coal cores. An integrated experimental apparatus was custom-designed for this study, combining volumetric sorption measurement with high-resolution strain monitoring via the confining fluid displacement (CFD) method and the confining pressure response (CPR) method. This setup enables the quantification of CO2-coal interactions under precisely controlled stress environments. Key findings reveal that stress conditions exert a regulatory role in shaping CO2-coal behavior: constant confining pressure conditions enhance CO2 adsorption capacity and sustain adsorption kinetics by accommodating matrix swelling, thereby preserving pore accessibility for continuous gas uptake. In contrast, constant volume constraints lead to rapid internal stress buildup, which inhibits further gas adsorption and accelerates the attainment of kinetic saturation. Sorption-induced swelling exhibits clear dependence on both pressure and constraint conditions. Elevated CO2 pressure leads to increased strain, while constant confining pressure facilitates more gradual, sustained expansion. This is particularly evident at higher pressures, where adsorption-induced swelling prevails over mechanical constraints. These results help resolve key discrepancies in the existing literature by clarifying the dual role of stress in modulating both pore accessibility (for gas transport) and mechanical response (for matrix deformation). These insights provide essential guidance for optimizing CO2 injection strategies and improving the long-term performance and sustainability of CO2-ECBM and geological carbon storage projects, ultimately supporting global efforts in carbon emission reduction and sustainable energy resource utilization.",SUSTAINABILITY,2025,"Fang, ZM; Yang, CL; Shen, SC",10.3390/su17208990,,WOS:001604460300001,A

Detection of granuloma in histopathological evaluation proves the diagnosis, but endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is associated with a high sampling error. However, prompt immunosuppressive therapy may significantly affect patient's prognosis. By analyzing our single center cohort of patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy after failure of endocardial ablation, we looked for additional markers supporting the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis.MethodIn the last 4 years, 135 patients (mean age 49 y, 63% male) were hospitalized for epicardial ventricular arrhythmia (VA) ablation after failure of endocardial ablation. Nineteen patients had either previously received a diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis or were newly diagnosed. The mean follow-up time was 4.3 years. The ECG criteria, primary manifestation, histological findings in EMB, history of VT ablation, distribution of scars on MRI, electroanatomical mapping (EAM), PET CT findings, presence of atrial tachycardias, valve disease and comorbidities were analyzed.ResultsSix of 19 (32%) patients showed right bundle block; 6 of 19 (32%) had AV nodal disease, including 4 patients with AV-block III; and 14 patients (73%) primarily presented with ventricular arrhythmias (including 3 with cardiac arrest). In all 19 patients cardiac EMB revealed elevated CD68 macrophages and CD3 T lymphocytes, and 7 of 19 were positive for granuloma (36,8%). Six of 6 patients (100%) undergoing PET CT showed acute inflammation. By analyzing the scar distribution, the most common locations were basal anteroseptal, basal inferoseptal, mid inferoseptal, mid inferior and the septal RV/RVOT. (septal substrate in 100%). There was a high correlation between the findings on the MRIs and low voltage in the electroanatomical mapping EAM). All patients received an immunosuppressive therapy.

Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), nevertheless, yielded mainly scattered atypical epithelial cells with a small cohesive columnar component, and adenocarcinoma was diagnosed; further subclassification was not feasible on the limited cytologic material. Because the tumor was radiologically resectable, neoadjuvant gemcitabine plus S-1 was administered. Follow-up CT showed enlargement to 5.5 cm, new invasion of the spleen and gastric wall, and peripheral progressive enhancement-previously demonstrated on MRI-now appreciable on CT, while distant disease remained absent. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, regional lymphadenectomy, and partial gastrectomy was performed. The resected specimen revealed a whitish solid tail tumor with focal hemorrhage/necrosis; histology confirmed PACP. Adjuvant S-1 was initiated 1 month postoperatively. Three months after surgery, CA19-9 increased despite no recurrence on CT. One month later he presented with exertional dyspnea and complete atrioventricular block. Echocardiography and CT showed an approximately 8-cm interatrial mass and a left-ventricular wall lesion. Retrospective review of CT performed 1 month earlier identified a 2-cm atrial nodule at the same site, indicating very rapid intracardiac growth. He was transferred to a cardiovascular center for planned pacemaker implantation, and heart-failure therapy was initiated first. During preparation he developed sudden cardiac arrest and died. Postmortem myocardial biopsy confirmed PACP metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians need to recognize that PACP can metastasize to the heart and incorporate this risk into routine follow-up, maintaining vigilance for imaging features suggestive of cardiac involvement and for new-onset cardiac symptoms or conduction disturbances; when cardiac metastasis is suspected, prompt evaluation and intervention are warranted.",SURGICAL CASE REPORTS,2026,"Shigematsu, K; Kozono, S; Fujii, A; Abe, N; Kuga, H; Tamiya, S; Nakano, T",10.70352/scrj.cr.25-0567,,WOS:001659229500001,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,CVP and echo Measurements are Associated with Improved Outcomes in Patients with Gastrointestinal (GI) Hemorrhage: A Retrospective Analysis of the MIMIC- IV Database,"Purpose: Mortality associated with acute Gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage in intensive care units (ICU) has remained high in patients suffering from hemodynamic instability. Prompt recognition and rapid assessment of bleeding severity are crucial to improve survival. Central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring is commonly used for early recognition of intravascular imbalances, but its effectiveness in predicting fluid responsiveness is often questioned. Echocardiography (echo) is a rapid, noninvasive method to repeatedly assess cardiac function and fluid responsiveness. This study investigated the impact of CVP and echo measurements on the outcomes of critically ill patients with GI hemorrhage. Methods: The study was based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC- IV) database. Patients were divided into four groups according to the usage of CVP and/or echo. The primary outcomes were 7-day, 14-day, 28-day, and overall mortalities after ICU admission. Cox Proportional-Hazards Models were used to elucidate the relationship between CVP/ Echo monitoring and mortality. The severity of illness of patients were adjusted by qSOFA score, SOFA score and base deficit level at admission. Results: Among 1705 eligible patients, 82 patients had both CVP and echo, 85 had CVP only, and 116 had Echo only. The results of survival analysis indicated that, comparing with those without either CVP or echo, the echo utilization was associated with improved mortalities at all time points during ICU stay for patients with moderate GI hemorrhage, and the combined use of CVP and echo was associated with lower 7-day,14-day and overall mortalities for patients with severe GI hemorrhage. Conclusion: Early usage of CVP and echo monitoring or echo alone are associated with lower mortality in the short and long-term when compared to patients without either measurement. Clinicians should consider goal-directed resuscitation guided by echo with/without CVP in patients with GI hemorrhage early after admission to ICU.",JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE,2022,"Song, WY; Mobli, K; Jupiter, DC; Radhakrishnan, RS",10.1177/08850666211046175,,WOS:000708295700001,A

Methods: From August 2004 to August 2006 all patients (age 25-84 years) dying within 24 h after hospitalization in a large tertiary care academic teaching hospital were screened regarding an underlying cardiovascular cause of death. Results: After validation, 79 out of 1,352 patients remained with a final diagnosis of AMI. Sixty-six percent of these experienced prehospital cardiac arrest or shock. In 37% no resuscitation attempts were performed in-hospital, the most common reason being multimorbidity. Only 23% could be transferred to coronary angiography for revascularisation attempts. An independent panel of clinicians judged that only in one patient would another management strategy have been promising. Of interest, 33% of the deceased patients had typical or atypical chest pain the days before the lethal event. Conclusion: A large percentage of AMI patients who died soon after hospitalization were in critical circulatory state directly before hospitalization. In 37%, in-hospital resuscitation attempts were omitted for understandable reasons. Options for improvement in acute care in the investigated setting were not found.

The following report details a case of a term newborn infant who had evidence of poor intake while exclusively breastfeeding during his hospital stay that may not have been recognized by health care providers. The infant was discharged home and was subsequently found by the parents in cardiac arrest 12 h after discharge and was found to have hypernatremic dehydration. Although return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after fluid resuscitation, the infant sustained extensive hypoxic-ischemic brain injury due to cardiovascular collapse. Due to the infant's extremely poor prognosis, life support was withdrawn at 19 days of age and the infant expired. This sentinel case demonstrates multiple pitfalls of current perceptions of normal vs. abnormal newborn feeding behavior, weight loss percentages, elimination patterns, and acceptable clinical thresholds believed to be safe for neonates. Newer data have shown that hypernatremia occurs commonly in healthy, term breastfed newborns at weight loss percentages previously deemed normal by most health professionals and hospital protocols.

In Mexico, previous estimates suggest that it causes an average of 33 000 deaths per year; however, the data are not precise. Half of all sudden cardiac death events are due to out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest which, if not treated promptly, leads to sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the ability to respond promptly and adequately to these events with the necessary maneuvers and equipment improves the survival of the victims.To address this problem, in some states of the country, cardioprotected spaces have been created to allow timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cardiac defibrillation maneuvers to be performed in public access.

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of the ICU nursing grade on mortality and cost-effectiveness in CS. MethodsA nationwide analysis was performed using the K-NHIS database. Patients diagnosed with CS and admitted to the ICU at tertiary hospitals were enrolled. ICU nursing grade was defined according to the bed-to-nurse ratio: grade1 (bed-to-nurse ratio < 0.5), grade2 (0.5 <= bed-to-nurse ratio < 0.63), and grade3 (0.63 <= bed-to-nurse ratio < 0.77) or above. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Cost-effective analysis was also performed. ResultsOf the 72,950 patients with CS, 27,216 (37.3%) were in ICU nursing grade 1, 29,710 (40.7%) in grade 2, and 16,024 (22.0%) in grade >= 3. The adjusted-OR for in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with grade 2 (grade 1 vs. grade 2, 30.6% vs. 37.5%, adjusted-OR 1.14, 95% CI1.09-1.19) and grade >= 3 (40.6%) with an adjusted-OR of 1.29 (95% CI 1.23-1.36) than those with grade 1. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of grade1 compared with grade 2 and >= 3 was $25,047/year and $42,888/year for hospitalization and $5151/year and $5269/year for 1-year follow-up, suggesting that grade 1 was cost-effective. In subgroup analysis, the beneficial effects of the high-intensity nursing grade on mortality were more prominent in patients who received CPR or multiple vasopressors usage.

As with many jurisdictions in North America, their rehabilitation needs have become considerably more challenging over time. This paper focusses on the design considerations to rehabilitate two sites with egg shaped monolithic concrete combined sewers with numerous major defects in the form of sewer fabric decay (i.e. general surficial material degradation), localized invert loss, infiltration, and longitudinal four point fractures. The sections included pipes that were 1,800 mm highx1,350 mm wide (72""x54"") and 2,700 mm highx1800 mm wide (108""x72"") and conveyed dry weather flows ranging from 1.9 to 162.8 L/s (30 to 2,580 USGPM), respectively. The combination of defects present with active infiltration meant that active deterioration processes were present in form ground loss around the sewers. The sites themselves posed considerable access challenges, as one was located on a former road right of way now leased to a private recycling company and located adjacent to active Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) tracks. Proximity to active rail tracks necessitated seeking approval from CPR on a detailed sequential phasing plan for the shaft construction. Since the requirements for the shafts were dictated by both the rehabilitation method and the contractor's means of shoring construction, final approval for shaft construction at the site could not take place until after contractor procurement. Design and procurement included five unique rehabilitation alternative systems: reinforced cured in place pipe (CIPP), grouted in place glass reinforced polymer (GRP) liners, bonded in place fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) liners, centrifugally cast concrete pipe (CCCP), and grouted-in-place spiral wound PVC strip liners. Each technology was assessed and specified based on their unique installation and long term performance characteristics. While all of the deteriorated pipes appeared stable and were not at risk of short term failure; some of the pipes displayed evidence of accelerating deterioration which required a rehabilitation system designed for full pipe-soil loading models as well as hydrostatic groundwater loads. Design methodologies and minimum quality assurance (QA) requirements were dictated by the tender documents for each rehabilitation technology to promote an ""equal"" assessment of alternative technologies in a competitive environment. The rehabilitation contract was awarded based on the use of reinforced CIPP technology in late 2017 and installation of the liners was completed in November 2018.","PIPELINES 2019: CONDITION ASSESSMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND REHABILITATION",2019,"Macey, C; Braun, A; Kehler, N; Cournoyer, S",,,WOS:000494639000033,A

The early reperfusion phase is critical for the outcome. Intervention strategies directed to this period are promising to reduce ACA/resuscitation-dependent impairments. This study focused on the evaluation of the protective potential of an extract from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (GP), a plant used in traditional medicine with antioxidative, glucose lowering and neuroprotective activities, in an ACA rat model. We tested the following parameters: i) Basic systemic parameters such as pCO(2) and blood glucose value within the first 30 min post-ACA; ii) mitochondrial response by determining activities of citrate synthase, respiratory chain complexes I + III and II + III, and the composition of cardiolipin 6 and 24 h post-ACA; iii) neuronal vitality of the CA1 hippocampal region by immunohistochemistry 24 h and 7 days post-ACA; and iv) cognitive function by a novel object recognition test 7 days post-ACA. GP, administered after reaching spontaneous circulation, counteracted the following: i) ACA-mediated increases in arterial CO2 tension and blood glucose values; ii) transient increase in the activity of the respiratory chain complexes II + III; iii) elevation in cardiolipin content; iv) hippocampal CA1 neurodegeneration, and v) loss of normal novelty-object seeking. The protective effects of GP were accompanied by side effects of the vehicle DMSO, such as the stimulation of citrate synthase activity in control animals, inhibition of cardiolipin synthesis in ACA animals and complex II + III activity in both control and ACA animals. The results emphasize the importance of the early post-resuscitation phase for the neurological outcome after ACA/resuscitation, and demonstrated the power of GP substitution as neuroprotective intervention.

Subsequently, she had episodes of chest pain with high sensitivity Troponin I elevation to 1509 ng/L with accompanying septal T wave inversions, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction to 49% and basal septal wall hypokinesis. Computed tomography (CT) coronary angiogram showed patent coronary arteries and no coronary arterial dissection. The patient was conservatively managed with aspirin and metoprolol, and on follow up had fully recovered left ventricular function with resolution of wall motion abnormalities. Given this, coronary vasospasm due to intramuscular methylergonovine is the most likely cause of patient's chest pain and associated myocardial ischemia.ConclusionsIntramuscular, intrauterine, intravenous, and even oral methylergonovine can rarely cause coronary vasospasm leading to myocardial ischemia.

However, some people have hearing defects that can prevent them from understanding the AED verbal prompts. Moreover, even rescuers with normal hearing function may not easily understand the AED verbal prompts when operating in a noisy environment. This study was designed to assess the capability of rescuers to defibrillate effectively using an AED which included visual prompts. Methods and results: Nine deaf employees with no previous experience in basic life support (BLS) or defibrillation were asked to defibrillate a manikin following the text prompts of a Heartstart FR2+ AED. Subjects were tested before and after a 6 h BLS-AED course carried out with the help of a sign language interpreter. Before training, seven out of nine deaf subjects (78%) were able to defibrillate, eight out of nine subjects (89%) placed the pads correctly, and the mean time to defibrillation was 101.6 +/- 28.4 s. After the course, all subjects were able to complete the defibrillation sequence and place the pads correctly. The mean post-course time to defibrillation was 47.8 +/- 5.4 s (P < 0.001). None of the nine subjects touched the manikin during charging of the defibrillator and shock delivery before or after the course. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that untrained deaf rescuers can use AEDs appropriately providing that the defibrillator has visual instructions.

Bladder and urethral injuries can result in infection, urinary obstruction, and long-term complications. However, diagnosing LUTI in hemodynamically unstable patients remains particularly challenging, as advanced imaging studies such as retrograde cystography, computed tomography (CT) cystography, and retrograde urethrography (RUG) are typically deferred until after initial resuscitation and stabilization. This study reviews 13 years of clinical experience with blunt pelvic fracture-related LUTI, focusing on the diagnostic role of CT imaging. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed pelvic fracture cases with hematuria at a tertiary center from 2009 to 2021. All patients received abdominal and pelvic CT scans on admission. We recorded demographic data, injury characteristics, Injury Severity Score (ISS), diagnostic methods, and infection rates. Comparisons were made between patients with bladder and urethral injuries. The characteristics of patients with LUTI diagnosed on initial CT and those with delayed diagnosis were summarized descriptively. Results Of 2,865 patients with pelvic fractures, 127 (4.4%) were diagnosed with LUTI. The median age was 36 years, and 76% were male, with a median ISS of 26. Bladder injuries were present in 54% of LUTI cases, urethral injuries in 40%, and combined injuries in 6%. Diagnosis via CT was significantly higher for bladder injuries (58%) than urethral injuries (20%). Among those diagnosed with CT in the emergency department, 40% patients did not undergo further urological imaging. Thirteen patients (10%) had delayed diagnoses, primarily due to initial focus on life-saving interventions. No significant difference in outcomes was noted between early and delayed diagnoses. Conclusion CT imaging is valuable for the initial evaluation of pelvic fractures with LUTI- particularly bladder injuries, by aiding early diagnosis and reducing the need for invasive diagnostic studies. Early recognition, especially within the first two weeks, remains essential to optimize patient outcomes.",BMC UROLOGY,2025,"Yang, YK; Wang, TM; Cheng, CT; Tee, YS; Liao, CH; Hsieh, CH; Fu, CY",10.1186/s12894-025-01928-y,,WOS:001595532900001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Reaching the public via a multi media campaign as a first step to nationwide public access defibrillation,"Public access defibrillation (PAD) is a promising strategy to fight sudden cardiac death. The Austrian Red Cross provided automated external defibrillators (AEDs) and basic life support (BILS) training as an ""all inclusive package"" combined with on site consultation and maintenance with annual retraining as a part of a nationwide PAD programme. A multi media campaign was started to promote the package and to increase awareness about sudden cardiac death. Data about the campaign, its recognition by the public in Austria and the number of packages were recorded. Sixty-eight percent of the Austrian public above the age of 15 years were able to recall the multi media campaign. Comparing the periods before and after the campaign, the number of website hits climbed significantly from 2931 hits/month (11866-6168) to 4812 hits/month (3432-13,434) (p = 0.0276). The number of AED services implemented before the campaign increased significantly (p=0.0026) in the time after the campaign. Therefore, we conclude that a multi media campaign is useful to stimulate public discussion and it encourages companies to buy ""all inclusive packages"" containing AEDs, BILS training, on site consultation and maintenance. These measures represent a possible first step in introducing PAD but it seems that they have to be continued on a constant basis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,"Sudden Cardiac and Noncardiac Death in Sports: Epidemiology, Causes, Pathogenesis, and Prevention","Although few doubts remain that physical exercise should be widely promoted for maintenance of health and fitness, the risk of adverse events such as sudden death (especially due to cardiac causes, i.e., sudden cardiac death [SCD]) during exercise remains tangible. The overall risk of sudden death in athletes is relatively low (i.e., usually comprised between 0.1 and 38/100,000 person-years), and globally comparable to that of the general population. However, up to 20% of all sudden death cases are still recorded while exercising. The most frequent underlying disorders encountered in SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery disease (CAD), representing three quarters of all conditions. The risk related to CAD increases with aging (>35 years old), while that attributable to cardiomyopathies or fatal arrhythmias is especially frequent among young people (<35 years old). Taken together, these findings would lead to the conclusion that physical exercise may be seen as an acute trigger of myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias in some predisposed individuals. Nonetheless, the prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis seems to be higher in athletes than in sedentary subjects with comparable risk profile. On the contrary, coronary plaques in physically active subjects appear more stable, thereby attenuating the risk of rupture and subsequent myocardial ischemia. These findings, along with evidence of a considerable increase of peak coronary blood flow during exercise, make it very likely that an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply may be the most frequent cause of myocardial ischemia in athletes suffering SCD and/or cardiac arrest. Therefore, all subjects who wish to practice moderate-to high-intensity exercise are recommended to undergo preparticipation screening and annual follow-up.",SEMINARS IN THROMBOSIS AND HEMOSTASIS,2018,"Lippi, G; Favaloro, EJ; Sanchis-Gomar, F",10.1055/s-0038-1661334,,WOS:000448968000008,A

This study aims to identify risk factors for perioperative cardiac arrest in children presenting for noncardiac surgery and characterise its outcomes. Methods: Using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) Pediatric Database 2019 and 2020, 261 276 patients were included. Patients >= 18 yr and cardiac surgical procedures were excluded. Exploratory multivariable analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of perioperative cardiac arrest and associated outcomes. Results: The overall rate of cardiac arrest was 0.1%, with an intraoperative rate of 0.05% and 48-h postoperative rate of 0.06%. Significant risk factors for perioperative cardiac arrest included age <12 months (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 3.07, P<0.001), American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status classification (ASA-PS 3 aOR=2.57, P<0.001; ASA-PS 4 aOR=5.27, P<0.001; ASA-PS 5 aOR=13.1, P<0.001), admission through the emergency room (aOR 1.7, P=0.003), inpatient (aOR 2.19, P=0.008), major and severe cardiac disease (aOR 1.58, P=0.008), impaired cognitive status (aOR 1.54, P=0.009), and longer anaesthesia duration (aOR 1.1 per 30 min, P<0.001). Perioperative cardiac arrest was significantly associated with longer hospital length of stay, reoperation, differences in discharge destination, and 30-day mortality. In addition, patients experiencing postoperative cardiac arrest had a significantly higher rate of in-hospital and 30-day mortality than those experiencing intraoperative cardiac arrest. Conclusions: The incidence of cardiac arrest in this study is higher than previously reported. This may be related to selection bias and the rigorous data collection required by NSQIP. Lower 30-day mortality after intraoperative cardiac arrest could be related to prompt recognition and rapid initiation of intraoperative resuscitation.

We examined the prevalence and predictors (clinical variables, personality, and anxiety) of PTSD in ICD patients. Method: Three hundred ninety-five ICD patients (20.1% female; mean age = 62.8 +/- 10.3 years) from two Dutch referral hospitals completed the 14-item Type D scale (DS14) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory to assess Type D (distressed) personality (high negative affect with social inhibition) and anxiety (on the State Anxiety Inventory) at the time of implantation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of PTSD at 18 months postimplantation. Results: At 18 months postimplantation, 30 patients (7.6%) qualified for a PTSD diagnosis. Of these patients, 55% (n = 16) had a Type D personality. 83% (n = 25) experienced anxiety at baseline, and 24% (a = 7) had experienced shocks during follow-up. Both Type D personality (odds ratio [OR] = 3.5) and baseline anxiety (OR = 4.3) were significant predictors of posttraumatic stress at 18 months postimplantation, independent of shocks and other clinical and demographic covariates.

A shocking choice?,"Many previously unexplained life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) in young individuals are now recognized to be genetic in nature and are ascribed to a growing number of distinct inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. These include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT), and short QT syndrome. Because of their lower frequency compared to coronary disease, risk factors for SCD are not very precise in patients with inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. As randomized studies are generally non-feasible and may even be ethically unjustifiable, especially in the presence of effective therapies, the risk assessment of malignant arrhythmic events such as SCD, cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF), appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) interventions, or ICD therapy on fast VT/VF to guide ICD implantation is based on observational data and expert consensus. In this document, we review risk factors for SCD and indications for ICD implantation and additional therapies. What emerges is that, allowing for some important differences between cardiomyopathies and channelopathies, there is a growing and disquieting trend to create, and then use, semi-automated systems (risk scores, risk calculators, and, to some extent, even guidelines) which then dictate therapeutic choices. Their common denominator is a tendency to favour ICD implantation, sometime with reason, sometime without it.

However, medical therapies targeted to improve quality of life are underused; when resting and/or exercise obstruction is present, an incremental and additive approach should be used based on a high dosage of beta-blockers, verapamil and/or disopyramide. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of atria[ fibrillation or A-V node has been proposed in some instances. Treatment of syncope or presyncope due to an abnormal blood pressure response during exercise remains challenging. Only patients with obstruction who remain severely symptomatic despite maximal. medical therapy should be considered for invasive procedures, including dual-chamber (DDD) pacing, ASA or surgery. The reported complication rates of ASA (essentially complete A-V block, incidence above 5-10%, with mortality rates ranging from 0-4%) and the benefits at medium-term follow-up appear comparable to those observed after myectomy, which, according to guidelines, should remain the primary treatment for most severely symptomatic drug-refractory young patients with obstruction. White the overall, survival of patients with HCM is similar to that of the general population, detection of patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death remains challenging, particularly in the young, and indications for ICDs in high risk patients without prior cardiac arrest should be patient- and family-orientated.

Lack of oxygen availability gives rise to depletion of NAD(+) tissue stores, decrease of ATP formation, weakening of the electron transport pump and anaerobic metabolism and acidosis, leading necessarily to death if oxygenation is not promptly re-established. Re-oxygenation triggers a cascade of compensatory biochemical events to restore function, which may be accompanied by improper homeostasis and oxidative stress. Consequences may be incomplete recovery, or excess reactions that worsen the biological outcome by disturbed metabolism and/or imbalance produced by over-expression of alternative metabolic pathways. Perinatal asphyxia has been associated with severe neurological and psychiatric sequelae with delayed clinical onset. No specific treatments have yet been established. In the clinical setting, after resuscitation of an infant with birth asphyxia, the emphasis is on supportive therapy. Several interventions have been proposed to attenuate secondary neuronal injuries elicited by asphyxia, including hypothermia. Although promising, the clinical efficacy of hypothermia has not been fully demonstrated. It is evident that new approaches are warranted. The purpose of this review is to discuss the concept of sentinel proteins as targets for neuroprotection. Several sentinel proteins have been described to protect the integrity of the genome (e.g. PARP-1; XRCC1; DNA ligase III alpha; DNA polymerase beta, ERCC2, DNA-dependent protein kinases). They act by eliciting metabolic cascades leading to (i) activation of cell survival and neurotrophic pathways; (ii) early and delayed programmed cell death, and (iii) promotion of cell proliferation, differentiation, neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis. It is proposed that sentinel proteins can be used as markers for characterising long-term effects of perinatal asphyxia, and as targets for novel therapeutic development and innovative strategies for neonatal care.",NEUROTOXICITY RESEARCH,2011,"Herrera-Marschitz, M; Morales, P; Leyton, L; Bustamante, D; Klawitter, V; Espina-Marchant, P; Allende, C; Lisboa, F; Cunich, G; Jara-Cavieres, A; Neira, T; Gutierrez-Hernandez, MA; Gonzalez-Lira, V; Simola, N; Schmitt, A; Morelli, M; Tasker, RA; Gebicke-Haerter, PJ",10.1007/s12640-010-9208-9,,WOS:000287710700010,A

This study aimed to assess the baseline knowledge of BLS among college students and evaluate the efficacy of a training intervention, gauging changes in confidence and performance scores.Methods:Following ethical approval, a pretraining BLS questionnaire was administered to participating students. Subsequently, American Heart Association-certified BLS training providers conducted hands-on training. Posttraining, participants completed confidence and their performance was evaluated by the training providers. Data analysis utilized a percentage-based methodology.Results:The findings from the questionnaire revealed that 87% of students had witnessed emergencies, with only 7.7% initiating help and 2.3% observing resuscitation efforts. Notably, a deficit in knowledge about automated external defibrillators was observed across all the participants. Approximately 49.5% expressed interest in training, while 41.7% declined periodic training. Concerningly, 53.7% cited fear of legal repercussions as a deterrent to aiding victims, and 30.09% attributed their nonintervention to a lack of BLS knowledge. Posttraining, 81.5% of students displayed average confidence, with 18.4% exhibiting poor confidence in providing roadside BLS assistance. Performance assessments revealed that 28.15% performed well, 52.90% performed at an average level, and 18.95% performed poorly during hands-on training with a mannequin.Conclusions:The study highlights a notable lack of awareness and understanding of BLS among college students, as evidenced by the pretraining questionnaire. The single training session employed in this study did not substantially enhance confidence or performance scores in providing BLS. The findings underscore the necessity for increased awareness and recurrent BLS training initiatives among the young population to bolster both confidence and practical proficiency in responding to emergency situations.",JOURNAL OF THE PRACTICE OF CARDIOVASCULAR SCIENCES,2024,"Chaskar, V; Thakkar, A; Zadkar, S; Gite, J",10.4103/jpcs.jpcs_60_23,,WOS:001376923600001,A

A descriptive study,"Background: Education of schoolchildren is an important issue in promoting the involvement of the lay public in improving survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. For this quality training it is necessary to know what schoolchildren know to establish what they need to learn about it. For this reason, the objective of this research was to evaluate the knowledge in SVB of schoolchildren in the 5th and 6th grades of Primary Education and students in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades of Secondary Education. Methods: During the first quarter of the 2021/2022 academic year, a survey was conducted of 947 Primary (n=308) and Secondary (n=639) schoolchildren between the ages of 10 and 17 from four schools supported with public funds from the Xunta de Galicia. Results: 62.81% of the students surveyed received prior training. 92.30% responded incorrectly to the correct sequence of action before a person with possible cardiac arrest and 93.14% did so to the correct order of execution of the AED for an effective shock. 82.40% of schoolchildren know the emergency telephone number. Secondary Education students and those who received prior training have better knowledge than Primary Education students (p < 0.001) and those who do not (p < 0.001), although in both cases they do not reach 5 points out of 10.

Virtual tools can facilitate high-quality self-directed resuscitation education; however, their role in teaching paediatric BLS remains unclear due to limited empiric evaluation and suboptimal design of existing tools. Aim: We describe the development and evaluation of a virtual simulation game (VSG) designed to teach highquality paediatric BLS using a self-directed, online format with integrated deliberate practice and feedback. Methods: We conducted a pilot prospective single-arm cohort study examining the VSG's impact on laypeople's paediatric BLS self-efficacy, attitudes, and knowledge as well as learner reactions. Data was collected using online surveys immediately after VSG completion and was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results: Fifty-five participants (median age 32 years, 76% female, 11% active certification in paediatric BLS) evaluated the VSG. Participants reported high self-efficacy, willingness to perform paediatric BLS, and high perceived knowledge after VSG completion. Fifty (91%) achieved a passing score (>= 13/15) on the paediatric BLS knowledge assessment. Learner reactions were favourable with 98% of participants agreeing that VSG educational content was clear and helpful. Mean System Usability Scale score was 81.1 (standard deviation 12.6) with a Net Promoter Score of 32 indicating high levels of usability and likelihood to recommend to others.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Effective Pain Control With Very Low Dose Palliative Radiation Therapy for Patients With Multiple Myeloma With Uncomplicated Osseous Lesions,"Background: Osteolytic lesions are present in 75% of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and frequently require palliation with radiation therapy (RT). Prior case series of patients with MM with bone pain undergoing palliative RT suggests doses >= 12 Gy (equivalent dose in 2Gy fractions, EQD2) provide excellent bone pain relief. However, recent advances in care and novel biologic agents have significantly improved overall survival and quality of life for patients with MM. We hypothesized that lower-dose RT (LDRT, EQD2 <12 Gy) offers an effective alternative to higher-dose RT (HDRT, EQD2 >= 12 Gy) for palliation of painful, uncomplicated MM bone lesions. Methods: We retrospectively identified patients with MM treated with RT for uncomplicated, painful bone lesions and stratified by EQD2 >=/< 12 Gy. Clinical pain response (CPR) rates, acute and late toxicity, pain response duration, and retreatment rates between LDRT and HDRT groups were analyzed. Results: Thirty-five patients with 70 treated lesions were included: 24 patients (48 lesions) treated with HDRT and 11 patients (22 lesions) with LDRT. Median follow-up was 14 and 16.89 months for HDRT and LDRT, respectively. The median dose of HDRT treatment was 20 Gy versus 4 Gy in the LDRT group. The CPR rate was 98% for HDRT and 95% for LDRT. There was no significant difference in any-grade acute toxicity between the HDRT and LDRT cohorts (24.5% vs 9.1%, X-2 P = .20). Pain recurred in 10% of lesions (12% HDRT vs 9.5% LDRT). Median duration of pain response did not significantly differ between cohorts (P = .91). Five lesions were retreated, 2 (9.5%) in the LDRT cohort, and 3 (6.3%) in the HDRT cohort. Conclusion: In this study, LDRT effectively palliated painful, uncomplicated MM bony lesions with acceptable CPR and duration of palliation. These data support prospective comparisons of LDRT versus HDRT for palliation of painful, uncomplicated MM bony lesions. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Experience of heart transplantation from hemodynamically unstable brain-dead donors with extracorporeal support. Abstract: The shortage of organ donors remains a major problem for transplantation worldwide. Potential donors after brain death may become hemodynamically unstable, despite maximal medical management, which ultimately leads to failure of organ procurement. We reviewed the medical records of five brain-dead potential donors who presented with hemodynamic instability despite maximal medical management that were supported by extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The outcomes of heart recipients were reviewed. The five donors under extracorporeal support finished a declaration of brain death without cardiac arrest. Donor organs, including three hearts, nine kidneys, and four livers, were harvested from the five donors under ECMO support. All three heart recipients recovered uneventfully after one yr of follow-up. Our experience indicates that potential donors may experience central-failure-related hemodynamic instability after brain death, despite maximal medical support, which leads to a fatal result. Beyond medical management, prompt and early extracorporeal support for salvaging brain-dead potential donors from cardiac death seems to be a practical strategy to increase the donor pool and preserve donor organs.",CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION,2012,"Yang, HY; Lin, CY; Tsai, YT; Lee, CY; Tsai, CS",10.1111/j.1399-0012.2011.01585.x,,WOS:000309917700035,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Early Thalamic Injury After Resuscitation From Severe Asphyxial Cardiac Arrest in Developing Rats,"Children who survive cardiac arrest often develop debilitating sensorimotor and cognitive deficits. In animal models of cardiac arrest, delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region has served as a fruitful paradigm for investigating mechanisms of injury and neuroprotection. Cardiac arrest in humans, however, is more prolonged than in most experimental models. Consequently, neurologic deficits in cardiac arrest survivors arise from injury not solely to CA1 but to multiple vulnerable brain structures. Here, we develop a rat model of prolonged pediatric asphyxial cardiac arrest and resuscitation, which better approximates arrest characteristics and injury severity in children. Using this model, we characterize features of microglial activation and neuronal degeneration in the thalamus 24 h after resuscitation from 11 and 12 min long cardiac arrest. In addition, we test the effect of mild hypothermia to 34 degrees C for 8 h after 12.5 min of arrest. Microglial activation and neuronal degeneration are most prominent in the thalamic Reticular Nucleus (nRT). The severity of injury increases with increasing arrest duration, leading to frank loss of nRT neurons at longer arrest times. Hypothermia does not prevent nRT injury. Interestingly, injury occurs selectively in intermediate and posterior nRT segments while sparing the anterior segment. Since all nRT segments consist exclusively of GABA-ergic neurons, we asked if GABA-ergic neurons in general are more susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic injury. Surprisingly, cortical GABA-ergic neurons, like their counterparts in the anterior nRT segment, do not degenerate in this model. Hence, we propose that GABA-ergic identity alone is not sufficient to explain selective vulnerability of intermediate and posterior nRT neurons to hypoxic-ischemic injury after cardiac arrest and resuscitation. Our current findings align the animal model of pediatric cardiac arrest with human data and suggest novel mechanisms of selective vulnerability to hypoxic-ischemic injury among thalamic GABA-ergic neurons.",FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY,2021,"Ton, HT; Raffensperger, K; Shoykhet, M",10.3389/fcell.2021.737319,,WOS:000741945000001,A

In case of TCA, it is important to initiate early fluid resuscitation. Initial cardiac rhythm serves as an indicator of outcomes in case of cardiac arrest. We aimed to find the association between prehospital hydration and outcomes of TCA according to initial cardiac rhythm. This is a retrospective, observational, crosssectional study. An examination was undertaken involving patients afflicted with TCA within the timeframe of 2014 to 2019. Exposure was defined to encompass prehospital hydration; interactive exposure was categorized by initial cardiac rhythm (non -shockable vs. shockable); the primary outcome was defined as good neurological status at discharge, whereas the secondary outcome was defined as survival to discharge. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A comprehensive analysis was conducted on a cumulative of 20,247 patients. Rates of good neurological status and survival to discharge were 0.2% and 8.3% (non -shockable rhythm group) and 3.0% and 16.7% (shockable rhythm group), respectively. However, rates of good neurological status and survival to discharge were 0.2% and 7.9% (non-prehospital hydration group) and 0.3% and 10.0% (hydration group), respectively. Compared to the non -hydration group, the AORs for good neurological status at discharge was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.77-2.69) for the hydration group. Moreover, compared to the non -shockable rhythm group, the AORs for good neurological status at discharge was 19.74 (95% CI: 10.46-27.26) in the shockable rhythm group. The interaction analysis conducted between prehospital hydration and initial rhythm unveiled the efficacy of prehospital hydration in promoting favorable survival to discharge outcomes in the non -shockable rhythm group.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Recommendations of the Committee of Andrology and Sexual Medicine of the AFU concerning the management of Vasectomy,"Objectives. - To answer the main clinical questions asked by practitioners and men consulting for a vasectomy request. Method. - The CPR method was used. The clinical questions were formulated according to the PICO methodology. A Pubmed literature search for the period 1984-2021 identified 508 refe-rences, of which 79 were selected and analyzed with the GRADE grid. Recommendations. - Vasectomy is a permanent, potentially reversible contraception. It is a safe procedure. A second vasectomy is necessary in only 1 % of cases. Surgical complications (hematoma, infection, pain, etc.) are rare. The frequency of prolonged scrotal pain after vasec-tomy is about 5 %, and less than 2 % describe a negative impact of this pain on their quality of life. Vasectomy does not have negative consequences on sexuality. The only contraindication to vasectomy is the minor patient. Patients at increased risk of remorse are single, divorced or separated men under the age of 30. Sperm storage may be particularly appropriate for them. Whatever the reason, the law allows the surgeon to refuse to perform the vasectomy. He must inform the patient of this at the first consultation. The choice of the type of anesthesia is left to the discretion of the surgeon and the patient. It must be decided during the preoperative consultation. Local anesthesia should be considered first. General anesthesia should be parti-cularly considered in cases of anxiety or intense sensitivity of the patient to palpation of the vas deferens, difficulty palpating the vas deferens, or a history of scrotal surgery that would make the procedure more complex. Concerning the vasectomy technique, 2 points seem to improve the efficiency of the vasectomy: coagulation of the deferential mucosa and interpo-sition of fascia. Leaving the proximal end of the vas deferens free seems to reduce the risk of post-vasectomy syndrome without increasing the risk of failure or complications. No-scalpel vasectomy is associated with a lower risk of postoperative complications than conventional vasectomy. Regarding follow-up, it is recommended to perform a spermogram at 3 months post-vasectomy and after 30 ejaculations. If there are still a few non-motile spermatozoa at 3 months, it is recommended that a check-up be performed at 6 months post-vasectomy. In case of motile spermatozoa or more than 100,000 immobile spermatozoa/mL at 6 months (defining failure), a new vasectomy should be considered. Contraception must be maintained until the effectiveness of the vasectomy is confirmed. (c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The World Health Organization (WHO) supports the Kids Save Lives (KSL) initiative, recommending basic life support (BLS) training for children aged >= 11 years. However, disparities in BLS education persist globally, particularly in low-resource regions where socioeconomic barriers, such as school type, malnutrition, and limited infrastructure, hinder implementation. Younger children (aged <11 years) face additional challenges due to physical limitations (eg, height, weight, and grip strength), which may compromise their ability to achieve adequate chest compression depth. While gamified learning has shown promise in improving BLS engagement and skill acquisition, its efficacy across diverse socioeconomic groups remains understudied.<br /> Objective: This study aimed to compare cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performance (compression depth, rate, and recoil) between public and private school students following a game-based BLS intervention and evaluate the feasibility of a serious game (Kids Save Hearts) in improving BLS knowledge and irrespective of socioeconomic background.<br /> Methods: We conducted an observational cohort study with 336 students aged 7-17 years from 10 public and 10 private schools in Brazil (April to November 2022). Participants received 40 minutes of video-based CPR training (American Heart Association CPR in Schools) followed by 10 minutes of gamified training using the Children Save Hearts serious game (SG). CPR quality was assessed via quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (QCPR) scores (Laerdal QCPR manikin), measuring compression depth (mm), compression rate (per minute), and chest recoil. Anthropometric data (height, weight, and grip strength) and socioeconomic indicators (school type) were collected. Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests) and multivariate regression (SPSS v27.0; IBM Corp) were used to analyze associations between demographics, physical characteristics, and CPR performance.<br /> Results: Older students (11-17 years) outperformed younger peers (7-10 years) in median compression depth (48 mm vs 37 mm; P<.001) and overall QCPR scores (84 vs 42, P<.001). Private school students had higher grip strength (24.92 vs 21.48 g/cm2; P=.001), but school type did not significantly affect CPR quality. Postintervention SG scores improved universally (P<.001), with no age or socioeconomic disparities.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Temporary mechanical circulatory support devices: updates from recent studies,"Purpose of review Over the past several years, the role of short-term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices has become the dominant focus in efforts to improve outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS). Alongside these efforts, temporary MCS devices have been increasingly used to support patients prior to cardiac surgery, during high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, awaiting cardiac transplantation, and in the setting of refractory cardiac arrest. The present review aims to provide an update on the recent literature evaluating the evolving role of temporary MCS devices, and to provide insights into the current challenges and future directions of MCS research. Recent findings Recent observational data have demonstrated potential roles for intra-aortic balloon pump preoperatively in high-risk patients awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting, and advanced heart failure patients awaiting transplantation. Impella continues to demonstrate promising results as part of an early MCS strategy in CS, as a temporary bridge to transplantation, and as a mechanism for left ventricular unloading in patients on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Finally, the first randomized trial of ECMO facilitated resuscitation in the United States demonstrated improved survival in patients with refractory out of hospital cardiac arrest.

Crowdsourcing is the process of aggregating crowd wisdom to solve a problem. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize quantitative evidence on crowdsourcing to improve health. Methods We followed Cochrane systematic review guidance and systematically searched seven databases up to September 4th 2019. Studies were included if they reported on crowdsourcing and related to health or medicine. Studies were excluded if recruitment was the only use of crowdsourcing. We determined the level of evidence associated with review findings using the GRADE approach. Results We screened 3508 citations, accessed 362 articles, and included 188 studies. Ninety-six studies examined effectiveness, 127 examined feasibility, and 37 examined cost. The most common purposes were to evaluate surgical skills (17 studies), to create sexual health messages (seven studies), and to provide layperson cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) out-of-hospital (six studies). Seventeen observational studies used crowdsourcing to evaluate surgical skills, finding that crowdsourcing evaluation was as effective as expert evaluation (low quality). Four studies used a challenge contest to solicit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing promotion materials and increase HIV testing rates (moderate quality), and two of the four studies found this approach saved money. Three studies suggested that an interactive technology system increased rates of layperson initiated CPR out-of-hospital (moderate quality). However, studies analyzing crowdsourcing to evaluate surgical skills and layperson-initiated CPR were only from high-income countries. Five studies examined crowdsourcing to inform artificial intelligence projects, most often related to annotation of medical data. Crowdsourcing was evaluated using different outcomes, limiting the extent to which studies could be pooled. Conclusions Crowdsourcing has been used to improve health in many settings. Although crowdsourcing is effective at improving behavioral outcomes, more research is needed to understand effects on clinical outcomes and costs.

On his general examination, he was septic with necrotic patches in the perineum and bilateral scrotum. Imaging revealed soft tissue gas and collections in scrotum extending to the right retroperitoneum with massive collection suggestive of retroperitoneal abscess. Following resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics, immediate exploratory laparotomy was done to drain the retroperitoneal abscess followed by debridement of Fournier's gangrene. The patient remained well on follow up.Clinical discussion: Fournier gangrene is a fulminant polymicrobial infection of the perineum, scrotum and penis which when complicated by retroperitoneal extension, has a very high mortality. Majority of patients have an immunocompromised condition. Early diagnosis with prompt surgical drainage and debridement (within 6 hours) significantly reduces the mortality.Conclusion: High index of suspicion, careful clinical examination and timely use of imaging is crucial for early diagnosis of this rare but fatal complication of FG.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,PREHOSPITAL THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY IN MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION,"The extent of myocardial damage occurring during acute myocardial infarction is time dependent, and there is abundant evidence from most clinical trials that mortality reduction is greatest in patients treated early with thrombolytic agents, although beneficial effects have been shown with treatment initiated up to 12 hours after onset of symptoms. This temporal dependence of benefit was most clearly seen with the 47% mortality reduction obtained with streptokinase given within the first hour in the GSSI-1 trial (Table 1). The process of infarction may be completely aborted if reperfusion is initiated within 30 minutes after symptom onset. Current approaches designed to reduce the time delay between onset of symptoms and the inhibition of thrombolytic treatment include increasing public awareness of the need to seek prompt medical attention in the event of chest pain, reducing in-hospital delays in initiation of thrombolytic therapy, and administration of thrombolytic agents in the prehospital setting. Since the first paper on prehospital thrombolysis by Koren et al. in 1985 there have been numerous studies published, including several randomized trials comparing prehospital and in-hospital initiation of thrombolytic therapy (Table 2). In randomized studies patients received in the prehospital phase either a bolus or infusion with the thrombolytic agent followed by placebo after hospital admission, or placebo when first seen outside the hospital, followed by the thrombolytic agent after arrival at the hospital. This was performed in a double-blind fashion in some of the trials. Some of the feasibility and safety, others on time again, differences in ejection fraction and mortality benefit. Almost all have conclusively shown the practicability and safety of patient selection and administration of the thrombolytic agent. This positive result was observed in different organizational types of the emergency system: In the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention trial (MITI) patients with chest pain were screened by paramedics using a checklist of clinical inclusion and exclusion criteria. The paramedics then obtained a computer-interpreted ECG which was transmitted to the emergency department in the hospital where a physician made the decision on the form of treatment. The thrombolytic agent was then administered by the paramedic.

Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started immediately, and normal sinus rhythm was achieved after electrical cardioversion three times. He was admitted to the ICU for further care upon admission. A CT of the chest showed a potential vascular structure in between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Fundamentals in the clinical management of intoxication due to smoke inhalation,"Intoxication due to smoke inhalation is the main cause of morbidity and mortality from fires. Smoke is a mixture of carbon particles suspended in hot air containing toxic gases. Carbon monoxide (CO) and cyanuric acid are the gases that are mainly responsible for tissue anoxia. The clinical signs of intoxication due to smoke inhalation vary. They may include eye irritation, sore throat, laryngeal stridor, dysphagia, soot in sputum, cough, breathlessness, laryngeal spasm, bronchospasm, coronary syndrome, coma, hypoxemia, lactic acidosis, cyanosis, and death. A finding of soot in the nostrils, mouth or sputum suggests severe intoxication. Lactate dehydrogenase levels over 10 mmol/L are indicative of cyanuric acid levels over 40 mmol/L. Pulse oximetry has represented an important advance for diagnosis, examination, and follow-up in this setting. The possible need for early intubation must be assessed and oxygen administration (at 100%) is essential. The treatment of choice for cyanuric acid poisoning is hydroxocobalamin. This antidote must be administered promptly whenever a patient has inhaled smoke (soot in mouth, throat or sputum), shows neurologic signs (confusion, coma, agitation, convulsions), or has any of the following signs: bradypnea, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, shock, hypotension, lactate dehydrogenase over 8 mmol/L, or lactic acidosis.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Epinephrine-induced Effects on Cerebral Microcirculation and Oxygenation Dynamics Using Multimodal Monitoring and Functional Photoacoustic Microscopy,"Background:The administration of epinephrine after severe refractory hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrest restores systemic blood flow and major vessel perfusion but may worsen cerebral microvascular perfusion and oxygen delivery through vasoconstriction. The authors hypothesized that epinephrine induces significant microvascular constriction in the brain, with increased severity after repetitive dosing and in the aged brain, eventually leading to tissue hypoxia. Methods:The authors investigated the effects of intravenous epinephrine administration in healthy young and aged C57Bl/6 mice on cerebral microvascular blood flow and oxygen delivery using multimodal in vivo imaging, including functional photoacoustic microscopy, brain tissue oxygen sensing, and follow-up histologic assessment. Results:The authors report three main findings. First, after epinephrine administration, microvessels exhibited severe immediate vasoconstriction (57 & PLUSMN; 6% of baseline at 6 min, P < 0.0001, n = 6) that outlasted the concurrent increase in arterial blood pressure, while larger vessels demonstrated an initial increase in flow (108 & PLUSMN; 6% of baseline at 6 min, P = 0.02, n = 6). Second, oxyhemoglobin decreased significantly within cerebral vessels with a more pronounced effect in smaller vessels (microvessels to 69 & PLUSMN; 8% of baseline at 6 min, P < 0.0001, n = 6). Third, oxyhemoglobin desaturation did not indicate brain hypoxia; on the contrary, brain tissue oxygen increased after epinephrine application (from 31 & PLUSMN; 11 mmHg at baseline to 56 & PLUSMN; 12 mmHg, 80% increase, P = 0.01, n = 12). In the aged brains, microvascular constriction was less prominent yet slower to recover compared to young brains, but tissue oxygenation was increased, confirming relative hyperoxia.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Therapeutic Potential of Natural Compounds for Brain Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury,"Brain ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, commonly occurring in ischemic stroke and post-cardiac arrest scenarios, results in complex secondary damage involving oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. Despite decades of research, no pharmacological agent has yet been clinically approved for post-I/R neuroprotection. Natural compounds have recently gained attention for their multimodal therapeutic potential, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and neuroregenerative effects. This review highlights nine promising candidates-resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, berberine, ginkgolide B, baicalin, naringin, fucoidan, and astaxanthin-that exhibit efficacy in experimental models of I/R injury when administered after the insult. Their chemical structures, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of action are described in detail, focusing on key signaling pathways such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related (Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Importantly, we outline the selection criteria for these compounds, including demonstrated neuroprotective efficacy, mechanistic clarity, and translational feasibility. While several challenges remain-such as limited bioavailability, BBB penetration, and species-specific metabolism-emerging strategies like nanoparticle delivery, synthetic analogs, and drug combinations offer potential solutions. By emphasizing the therapeutic versatility and mechanistic diversity of these natural agents, this review supports their clinical potential and encourages further preclinical optimization and biomarker-guided human trials.",BIOLOGY-BASEL,2025,"Yoo, KY; Won, MH; Ahn, JH; Park, JH",10.3390/biology14091153,,WOS:001580646700001,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,"Outcomes of electrical injuries in the emergency department: epidemiology, severity predictors, and chronic sequelae","IntroductionElectrical injuries (EIs) represent a significant clinical challenge due to their complex pathophysiology and variable presentation, ranging from minor burns to severe internal organ damage. Despite their prevalence in both; domestic and occupational settings, there remains a rareness of systematic guidelines and comprehensive literature to aid clinicians in effectively managing these injuries. Understanding these factors is crucial for developing protocols that can mitigate the risk of delayed complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, in patients who initially appear stable.ObjectivesThis study aims to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical outcomes, and predictors of severe presentation in EIs, providing insights to improve patient assessment and management strategies.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted over 4 years. Data were collected from standardized medical records. The group of patients with severe complications included those who presented a life-threatening cardiac, respiratory, neurological, or biological impairment or died within the first 48 h of the EI.ResultsWe enrolled 118 cases of electrical injury (EI). Ages ranged from 4 to 82 years, with 31.3% under 15. EI incidence peaked in summer, with 63.5% being home accidents. High-voltage injuries occurred in 13.6%. The most common ED complaints were burns in children (59.5%) and trauma in adults (48.1%). ECG abnormalities correlated with tetany (p = 0.016), and palpitations (p = 0.014). Complications included cardiac arrest (n = 8), rhabdomyolysis (n = 23), and acute renal injury (n = 9). Severe EI was linked to respiratory distress and creatine kinase levels higher than >= 253 UI/l. A normal ECG within 1 h post-injury was correlated to a low risk of severe EI. At 2-year follow-up, 43.9% of survivors reported aesthetic sequelae, 25.3% had psychological disorders, and 7% of adults could not return to their previous occupations.ConclusionEIs are frequent, with diverse clinical presentations requiring multidisciplinary care.

Approximately 3,000 young Australians suffer from sudden cardiac death (SCD) each year, making this a major public health issue. However, there is significant variation in the way incidence is estimated resulting in discrepancy across reporting which impacts our ability to understand and prevent these devastating events. We describe the New South Wales (NSW) Sudden Cardiac Arrest Registry: a retrospective, data linkage study which will identify all SCAs in the young in NSW from 2009 through to June 2022. Objective To determine the incidence, demographic characteristics and causes of SCA in young people. We will develop an NSW-based registry that will contribute to a greater understanding of SCA including risk factors and outcomes.Methods The cohort will include all people who experience a SCA in the NSW community aged between 1 to 50 years. Cases will be identified using the following three datasets: the Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Register housed at NSW Ambulance, the NSW Emergency Department Data Collection, and the National Coronial Information System. Data from eight datasets will be collected, anonymised and linked for the entire cohort. Analysis will be undertaken and reported using descriptive statistics.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,CURRENT RESULTS OF CORONARY-BYPASS SURGERY AFTER FAILED ANGIOPLASTY,"Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) is a technique in continuous development. Since its introduction indications, number, quality of stenosis amenable to treatment and device employed have evolved leading to a change in the population undergoing treatment. Therefore surgical results obtained in the early 80's may not apply to the beginning of the 90's. This reason prompted us to review our recent experience. In the last 4 years (1989-1992) among 2563 PTCA procedures performed in our Institution, 114 patients (4.3%, CL 3.5%-5%) underwent urgent surgical revascularization because of failed angioplasty. Thirty-four patients (30%, CL 21%-38%) were older than 65 years; 68 patients (60%, CL 50%-68%) had multiple vessel disease; 63 patients (55%, CL 46%-64%) had previous Myocardial Infarction (M.I.); 20 patients (17%, CL 10%-24%)had already undergone a PTCA and 3 patients (2%, CL 0%-6%) had had coronary surgery. In 21 patients (18%, CL 11%-25%) the left ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF%) was below <50%, Complete revascularization was always performed with an average of 2.2 +/- 1 graft/patient. A Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) was implanted in 20 patients (17%, CL 10%-25%) of the patients and in 52% of cases requiring LAD grafts in the last two years. There were 2 deaths (1.7%, CL 0%-4%), both patients were in cardiac arrest before surgery (p < 0.001), 2 patients required a LVAD to be weaned from ECC and 7 patients (6%, CL 1%-10%)had an IABP inserted at the moment of surgery. Twenty-five patients (21%, CL 14%-29%) showed evidence of a new myocardial infarction. Only ongoing ischemia (51 patients: 27%, CL 19%-35%) at the moment of surgery was predictive of postoperative MI (48%, CL 30%-65%; p < 0.001). A perfusion catheter was inserted before surgery in 23 patients. In this group of patients the incidence of postoperative MI (17%, CL 2%-32 %) was lower than the group with ongoing ischemia (p = 0.01). We conclude that the current population undergoing surgery for failed PTCA has a high incidence of previous major cardiac events and multiple vessel disease. The incidence of postoperative MI remains higher than elective surgical cases and is one of the major pitfalls of the PTCA procedures, although the use of perfusion catheters contributes to reduce this complication.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The differentiation of the competitive athlete with physiologic cardiac remodeling from the athlete with cardiomyopathy,"There are currently 5 million active high school, collegiate, professional, and master athletes in the United States. Regular intense exercise by these athletes can promote structural, electrical and functional remodeling of the heart, which is termed the ""athlete's heart."" In addition, regular intense exercise can lead to pathological adaptions that promote or worsen cardiac disease. Many of the athletes in the United States seek medical care. Consequently, physicians must be aware of the normal cardiac anatomy and physiology of the athlete, the differentiation of the normal athlete heart from the athlete with cardiomyopathy, and the contemporary care of the athlete with a cardiomyopathy. In athletes with persistent cardiovascular symptoms, investigations should include a detailed history and physical examination, an ECG, a transthoracic echocardiogram, and in athletes in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, a maximal exercise stress test or a continuous ECG recording, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or cardiac computed tomography angiography when definition of the coronary anatomy or characterization of the aorta and the aortic great vessels is indicated. This article discusses the differentiation of the normal athlete with physiologic cardiac remodeling from the athlete with hypertrophic, dilated or arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy (ACM). The ECG changes in trained athletes that are considered normal, borderline, or abnormal are listed. In addition, the normal echocardiographic measurements for athletes who consistently participate in endurance, power, combined or heterogeneous sports are enumerated and discussed. Algorithms are listed that are useful in the diagnosis of trained athletes with borderline or abnormal echocardiographic measurements suggestive of cardiomyopathies along with the major and minor criteria for the diagnosis of ACM in athletes. Thereafter, the treatment of athletes with hypertrophic, dilated, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathies are reviewed. The distinction between physiologic changes and pathologic changes in the hearts of athletes has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Failure by the physician to correctly diagnose an athlete with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, or ACM, can lead to the sudden cardiac arrest and death of the athlete during training or sports competition. Conversely, an incorrect diagnosis by a physician of cardiac pathology in a normal athlete can lead to an unnecessary restriction of athlete training and competition with resultant significant emotional, psychological, financial, and long-term health consequences in the athlete.",CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY,2024,"Henning, RJ",10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2024.102473,,WOS:001266284700001,A

We conducted an online survey study between October 29, 2019, and November 15, 2019 with cardiac arrest survivors and caregiver members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation. We queried survivors as to whether they experienced cognitive or psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. Next, we queried both survivors and caregivers on the provision of resources through three metrics: (1) discussions with providers about potential cognitive or psychological symptoms, (2) neurologist or psychologist appointments scheduled by providers, and (3) mental health referrals by providers. We then ran Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests to compare the proportion of survivors and caregivers who reported resource provision (observed values) to the proportion of survivors who reported experiencing cognitive and psychological symptoms, respectively (expected values). We included responses from 167 survivors and 52 caregivers. A total of 73.1% (n = 122) survivors reported experiencing cognitive symptoms and 67.1% (n = 112) psychological symptoms since their cardiac arrest. When compared to these two proportions, provision of resources was significantly lower in all three metrics: (1) fewer discussions with providers about potential for developing cognitive symptoms (31%) and psychological symptoms (26.3%), (2) fewer neurologist appointments scheduled (8.4%) and psychologist appointments scheduled (4.8%), and (3) fewer referrals to mental health (6%). Informal caregivers also reported significantly lower provision of resources in all three metrics, with the exception of discussions about developing cognitive symptoms. Our results suggest that there are discrepancies in the provision of cognitive and psychological resources in cardiac arrest survivors with good neurologic recovery.

Method: We mapped the provision of cardiac rehabilitation core components to survivors of cardiac arrest and compared this with a reference group of patients after acute myocardial infarction using data from a cross-sectional programme-level survey among all hospitals (n=34) and municipalities (n= 98) in Denmark. Organizational factors of potential importance to service provision were considered: health care region, size of catchment area/population, type of department/municipality and socioeconomic index. Results: Response rates for the provision of each core component of cardiac rehabilitation ranged from 64% to 98%. All hospitals and municipalities provided some aspect of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest. Across hospitals, provision of four core components of cardiac rehabilitation to survivors of cardiac arrest was lower compared with post acute myocardial infarction patients: patient education (relative risk (RR) =0.45 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.75)), exercise training (RR=0.69 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.98)), screening for anxiety and depression (RR=0.64 (95% CI 0.46 to 0.90) and nutritional counselling RR=0.76 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.93)). No difference was found in the provision of core components across municipalities.

Objective: Routine laboratory parameters were analysed concerning their usefulness for an etiologic diagnosis. The parameters CPR, neopterin and antiendotoxin antibodies were included in the diagnostic profile. These investigations were based on the hypothesis that endotoxins may be of etiologic relevance due to their fever-evoking potential. Material and methods: Within three years 383 horses with fever were investigated and categorised into four different types of fever. Group I (fever of unknown origin) included all horses for which no reason for the fever could be identified during the initial and follow-up examinations. A blood sample was taken during the initial examination. An ELISA was used to determine CRP, neopterin and anti-endotoxin antibodies. Results were investigated for correlations with other clinico-chemical parameters. Results: Fever of unknown origin was diagnosed in 195 horses (50.9%) and thus was the most frequently diagnosed fever type. The mean of CRIP was within the reference range (8.08 mu g/l), whereas the mean of neopterin was increased (7.29 mmol/1). A pathological increase was observed for IgM-antibodies (Anti-Lipid-A-IgM 1.18 OD, Anti-Endotoxin-IgM 1.5 OD), Clinical relevance: The pyrogenic potential of endotoxins should be considered in the differential diagnosis in horses with fever of unknown origin.

Ideal burn care requires prompt interventions such as wound and body temperature management, infection control, and fluid resuscitation to prevent complications like burn progression and infection. In this study, we identify specific factors and outcomes associated with delayed admission to a regional burn center. Methods: Patients admitted to a large urban burn center from January 2015 to December 2023 were retrospectively queried, with subsequent collection of demographic and outcome variables from chart review. Descriptive statistics, Welch's t-tests of unequal variances, and Chi-square analysis were performed. Multiple logistic regression was performed to explore the association between delayed admission and ICU stay, ventilator requirements, and mortality. Results: A total of 3137 patients were included in the study. Approximately 63.4 % of patients were admitted within 24 h, while 36.6 % had a significant delay in care of over 24 h after injury. Male patients were likely to experience delayed admission (39.0 vs. 31.8 %, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in age between the two cohorts (38.6 vs. 39.7 years, p = 0.199). There was no significant difference in time to admission by racial background (p = 0.061). Total body surface area burned (TBSA) varied between the delayed and control cohorts (15.5+18.7 % vs. 8.2+12.9 %, p < 0.001). Patients who were single (p < 0.001) and lived alone (p = 0.011) were more likely to experience a delay in burn unit admission. Homelessness (p < 0.001), substance abuse disorder (p < 0.001), and uninsured status (p < 0.001) were also associated with delayed admission. In regression analysis when controlling for TBSA, delay in care was significantly associated with a greater requirement for ICU stay (p < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.021) but was not associated with increased mortality (p = 0.232). Conclusion: Sociodemographic variables such as homelessness, lack of social support, and substance abuse are associated with delayed burn unit admission.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Impact of Using Drones in Emergency Medicine: What Does the Future Hold?,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles or ""drones"" has expanded in the last decade, as their technology has become more sophisticated, and costs have decreased. They are now used routinely in farming, environmental surveillance, public safety, commercial product delivery, recreation, and other applications. Health-related applications are only recently becoming more widely explored and accepted. The use of drone technology in emergency medicine is especially promising given the need for a rapid response to enhance patient outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the main current and expanding applications of drone technology in emergency medicine and to describe challenges and future opportunities. Current applications being studied include delivery of defibrillators in response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, blood and blood products in response to trauma, and rescue medications. Drones are also being studied and actively used in emergency response to search and rescue operations as well as disaster and mass casualty events. Current challenges to expanding their use in emergency medicine and emergency medical system (EMS) include regulation, safety, flying conditions, concerns about privacy, consent, and confidentiality, and details surrounding the development, operation, and maintenance of a medical drone network. Future research is needed to better understand end user perceptions and acceptance. Continued technical advances are needed to increase payload capacities, increase flying distances, and integrate drone networks into existing 9-1-1 and EMS systems. Drones are a promising technology for improving patient survival, outcomes, and quality of life, particularly for those in areas that are remote or that lack funds or infrastructure. Their cost savings compared with ground transportation alone, speed, and convenience make them particularly applicable in the field of emergency medicine.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Deep Learning-Based Electrocardiogram Model (EIANet) to Predict Emergency Department Cardiac Arrest: Development and External Validation Study,"Background: In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a severe and sudden medical emergency that is characterized by the abrupt cessation of circulatory function, leading to death or irreversible organ damage if not addressed immediately. Emergency department (ED)-based IHCA (EDCA) accounts for 10% to 20% of all IHCA cases. Early detection of EDCA is crucial, yet identifying subtle signs of cardiac deterioration is challenging. Traditional EDCA prediction methods primarily rely on structured vital signs or electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, which require additional preprocessing or specialized devices. This study introduces a novel approach using image-based 12-lead ECG data obtained at ED triage, leveraging the inherent richness of visual ECG patterns to enhance prediction and integration into clinical workflows. Objective: This study aims to address the challenge of early detection of EDCA by developing an innovative deep learning model, the ECG-Image-Aware Network (EIANet), which uses 12-lead ECG images for early prediction of EDCA. By focusing on readily available triage ECG images, this research seeks to create a practical and accessible solution that seamlessly integrates into real-world ED workflows. Methods: For adult patients with EDCA (cases), 12-lead ECG images at ED triage were obtained from 2 independent data sets: National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and Far Eastern Memorial Hospital (FEMH). Control ECGswererandomlyselected from adult ED patients without cardiac arrest during the same study period. In EIANet, ECG images werefirst converted to binary form, followed by noise reduction, connected component analysis, and morphological opening. A spatial attention module was incorporated into the ResNet50 architecture to enhance feature extraction, and a custom binary recall loss (BRLoss) was used to balance precision and recall, addressing slight data set imbalance. The model was developed and internally validated on the NTUH-ECG data set and was externally validated on an independent FEMH-ECG data set. The model performance was evaluated using the F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results: There were 571 case ECGs and 826 control ECGs in the NTUH data set and 378 case ECGs and 713 control ECGs in the FEMH data set. The novel EIANet model achieved an F1-score of 0.805, AUROC of 0.896, and AUPRC of 0.842 on the NTUH-ECG data set with a 40% positive sample ratio. It achieved an F1-score of 0.650, AUROC of 0.803, and AUPRC of 0.678 on the FEMH-ECG data set with a 34.6% positive sample ratio. The feature map showed that the region of interest in the ECG was the ST segment. Conclusions: EIANet demonstrates promising potential for accurately predicting EDCA using triage ECG images, offering an effective solution for early detection of high-risk cases in emergency settings.

Methods This single-center, follow-up cohort study involved patients with advanced cancer who received chemotherapy at Tohoku University Hospital. Patients were surveyed at enrollment, and we followed clinical events for 5 years from enrollment in the study. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent factors related to SPC use and chemotherapy in the last month before death. Results We analyzed a total of 135 patients enrolled between January 2015 and January 2016. No patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and few received resuscitation or ventilation. We identified no factors significantly associated with SPC use. Meanwhile, younger age (20-59 years, odds ratio [OR] 4.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-12.91; p = 0.02) and no receipt of SPC (OR 4.32; 95% CI 1.07-17.37; p = 0.04) were associated with chemotherapy in the last month before death. Conclusion Younger age and a lack of SPC were associated with chemotherapy at the EOL in patients with advanced cancer in Japan.

Researchers and clinicians have a greater understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation (AF), which has transpired into improved methods of detection, risk stratification, and treatments. The introduction of novel oral anticoagulants has provided clinicians with alternative options in managing patients with AF at moderate to high thromboembolic risk and further data has been emerging on the use of catheter ablation for the treatment of symptomatic AF. Another area of intense research in the field of cardiac arrhythmias and pacing is in the use of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) for the treatment of patients with heart failure. Following the publication of major landmark randomised controlled trials reporting that CRT confers a survival advantage in patients with severe heart failure and improves symptoms, many subsequent studies have been performed to further refine the selection of patients for CRT and determine the clinical characteristics associated with a favourable response. The field of sudden cardiac death and implantable cardioverter defibrillators also continues to be actively researched, with important new epidemiological and clinical data emerging on improved methods for patient selection, risk stratification, and management.

Death place is a palliative care quality indicator. Objectives: To determine the use of Canadian hospitals by patients who died in hospital during the 2019-2020 year and any additional hospital utilization occurring over their last 365 days of life. Design: An investigation of population-based (2018-2020) Canadian hospital data using SAS. Settings/Subjects: All patients admitted to hospital and discharged alive or deceased. Measurements: Describe patients who died in hospital, and any additional use of hospitals by these patients over their last year of life. Results: Ninety-one thousand six hundred forty inpatients died during 2019-2020; 4.85% of all 1.88 million hospitalized individuals and 41.82% of all deaths in Canada that year. Decedents were primarily 65+ years of age (81.16%), male (53.44%), admitted through an emergency department (80.16%), and arrived by ambulance (72.15%). The most common diagnosis was the nonspecific ICD-10 defined ''factors influencing health status and contact with health services'' (23.75%), followed by ''circulatory diseases'' (18.22%), ''respiratory diseases'' (15.58%), and many other less common diagnoses. The average length of final hospital stay was 16.54 days, with 89.97% having some Alternative Level of Care (ALC) or ALC days recorded, indicating another care setting was preferable. Only 5.78% had cardiopulmonary resuscitation performed during their final hospitalization. Of all 91,640 decedents, 74.33% had only one admission to hospital in their last 365 days of life, while 25.67% (more often younger than older decedents) had two to five admissions. Conclusions: This study confirms a continuing shift of death and dying out of hospital in Canada. Most deaths and end-of-life care preceding death take place outside of hospitals now. Enhanced community-based services are recommended to support optimal dying processes outside of hospitals and also help more dying people avoid hospital deaths.",JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE,2024,"Wilson, DM; Zhou, YL; Bykowski, KA; Fiore, C; Heron, J; Salas, AS",10.1089/jpm.2023.0226,,WOS:001155762200011,A

MethodsPatients with RI (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) were identified from the Midwest STEMI consortium, a prospective registry of four large regional programs comprising consecutive patients over 17 years. Primary outcome was in-hospital and 1-year mortality stratified by RI status and presence of CS/CA among patients with STEMI referred for coronary angiography. ResultsIn a cohort of 13,463 STEMI patients, 13% (n = 1754) had CS/CA, 30% (n = 4085) had RI. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 5% (12% RI vs. 2% no-RI, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality 9% (21% RI vs. 4% no-RI, p < 0.001). Among uncomplicated STEMI, in-hospital mortality was 2% (4% RI vs. 1% no-RI, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality 6% (13% RI vs. 3% no-RI, p < 0.001). In STEMI with CS/CA, in-hospital mortality was 29% (43% RI vs. 15% no-RI, p < 0.001) and 1-year mortality 33% (50% RI vs. 16% no-RI, p < 0.001). Using Cox proportional hazards, RI was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in STEMI with CS/CA (odds ratio [OR]: 3.86; confidence interval [CI]: 2.6, 5.8). ConclusionsThe association of RI with in-hospital and 1-year mortality is disproportionately greater in those with CS/CA compared to uncomplicated STEMI presentations.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Nitrite therapy is neuroprotective and safe in cardiac arrest survivors,"Cardiac arrest results in significant mortality after initial resuscitation due in most cases to ischemia-reperfusion induced brain injury and to a lesser degree myocardial dysfunction. Nitrite has previously been shown to protect against reperfusion injury in animal models of focal cerebral and heart ischemia. Nitrite therapy after murine cardiac arrest improved 22 h survival through improvements in myocardial contractility. These improvements accompanied transient mitochondrial inhibition which reduced oxidative injury to the heart. Based on preliminary evidence that nitrite may also protect against ischemic brain injury, we sought to test this hypothesis in a rat model of asphyxia cardiac arrest with prolonged survival (7 d). Cardiac arrest resulted in hippocampal CA1 delayed neuronal death well characterized in this and other cardiac arrest models. Nitrite therapy did not alter post-arrest hemodynamics but did result in significant (75%) increases in CA1 neuron survival. This was associated with increases in hippocampal nitrite and S-nitrosothiol levels but not cGMP shortly after therapy. Mitochondrial function 1 h after resuscitation trended towards improvement with nitrite therapy. Based on promising preclinical data, the first ever phase I trial of nitrite infusions in human cardiac arrest survivors has been undertaken. We present preliminary data showing low dose nitrite infusion did not result in hypotension or cause methemoglobinemia. Nitrite thus appears safe and effective for clinical translation as a promising therapy against cardiac arrest mediated heart and brain injury. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A scoring algorithm that was built using binary logistic regression of variables available on admission was then converted to an additive risk score. The resultant scoring system is the BE- ALIVE score, which incorporates the following factors: Base Excess (1 point for <-2 mmol/L), Age (<65 years: 0 points, 65-74: 1 point, 75-84: 2 points, =85: 3 points), Lactate (<2 mmol/L: 0 points, 2-4.9: 1 point, 5-9.9: 3 points, =10: 6 points), Intubated (2 points), Left Ventricular function (mildly impaired or better: -1 point, moderately impaired: 1 point, severely impaired: 3 points) and External/out of hospital cardiac arrest 2 points). The scoring system was validated using a testing set of 515 patients presenting to Harefield Hospital in 2021. The validation metrics were excellent with a c-statistic of 0.9, Brier's score 0.06 vs a naive classifier of 0.15, Spiegelhalter's z-statistic probability of 0.267 and a calibration slope of 1.08.Conclusion The BE- ALIVE score is a simple and accurate scoring system to predict 30- day mortality in patients presenting with ACS.

The unavailability of primary brain directed measures of injury and effective therapy worsens the problem. We have embarked on better understanding the process of injury and recovery by developing an animal model in our laboratory. Using this model, we have discovered that the use of quantitative EEG (Q-EEG) analysis will allow us to titrate the brain injury, monitor the recovery process, study the electrophysiologicai and biochemical mechanisms of injury and recovery and detect the neuroprotective effect afforded by a drug that prevents neuronal death after injury. With ideas derived from the laboratory research, we have designed a study to test the applicability of QEEG analysis in human subjects resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Our preliminary analysis shows that our measure is able to track the neurological changes of these patients. With this very promising start of this QEEG based measure, we can utilize this technology to develop more rational and effective therapeutic strategies that will improve the neurological outcome in this patient population.","1ST INTERNATIONAL IEEE EMBS CONFERENCE ON NEURAL ENGINEERING 2003, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS",2003,"Geocadin, RG; Tong, SB; Bezerianos, A; Smith, S; Iwamoto, T; Thakor, NV; Hanley, DF",10.1109/CNE.2003.1196814,,WOS:000182404500077,A

This report evaluates the complications observed with the use of central venous catheters in 1,378 cases. Central venous catheters (n = 2,281) were placed in 1,378 children (728 boys: 650 girls). There were 1,012 temporary catheters (noncuffed/percutaneously placed) while 1,268 were inserted operatively, including 37 portacaths and 1,231 with dacron cuffs (Hickman, Broviac) for long-term use. A single catheter was inserted in 542 cases and multiple catheters in 836. Indications of catheter insertion included emergency resuscitation or access (501), malignancy (462), and intestinal dysfunction (415). Catheter infection occurred in 430 cases (18.8%). Of 219 infected temporary access catheters, 123 were removed while 96 were changed over a guide wire. Of 211 infected permanent catheters, 18 were immediately removed while 193 were  treated with i.v. (vancomycin, gentamicin) antibiotics. Forty-seven of 193 (24%) catheters were eventually removed because of persistent or recurrent infection (16 cases) or subsequent fungal sepsis due to Candida albicans (31 cases). Only 3 of 37 portacaths were removed because of infection. Bacterial isolates were single in 125 cases and multiple in 86. Organisms included Staphylococcus epidermidis in 104 cases, Staph. aureus in 65, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 51, Escherichia coli in 51, and others in 18. Catheter complications occurred in 107 (5%) cases, including symptomatic vessel thrombosis in 49, pneumothorax in 26, catheter migration in 25, vessel injury in 5, and catheter embolus in 2. Despite the relatively high complication rate there were no catheter-related deaths. Multiple-lumen catheters had twice the complication rate and infection rate of single lumen catheters (P < 0.05). Temporary percutaneous catheters had a complication/infection rate 1.5 times greater than permanent catheters (P < 0.05) that were operatively placed. Bacterial infection cleared with antibiotics in 76% of cases with catheter sepsis, however, secondary fungal infection necessitated prompt catheter removal. These data indicated that precutaneously placed catheters and multilumen catheters are associated with significantly higher complication and infection rates.

However, warm ischemia may have detrimental effects on graft function. Italian Law requires a no-touch period of at least 20 min, which is much longer compared to the 5 min accepted in most European countries. Materials and Methods This is an Italian single-centre retrospective review of all cDCD procedures performed from April 2021 to June 2025. Patients with severe brain injury undergoing withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) were considered for cDCD. After cardiac arrest and a no-touch period of 20 min, organ reperfusion was performed using abdominal or thoraco-abdominal normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) through femoral vessels cannulation. The primary endpoint was 30-day graft survival; secondary endpoints included: incidence of primary non-function (PNF) and non-anastomotic biliary stricture (NAS) in liver transplantation, PNF and delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney transplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) in heart and lung transplantation, and recipient's survival. Results: A total of 52 patients, 33 (63%) males, median age 74 (65-79) years, underwent WLST during the study period and were included in the cDCD program. Median functional warm ischemic time (WIT), total WIT, asystolic phase, and NRP duration were 37 (34-40), 40 (37-42), 24 (23-26), and 192 (166-212) min, respectively. A total of 123 organs (46 livers, 61 kidneys, 8 hearts, and 8 lungs) were considered suitable for transplantation, procured, and successfully transplanted in 115 recipients.

OBJECTIVE To investigate the benefits of catheter ablation in patients with varying numbers of nonmodifiable recurrence risk factors (NMRRFs). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was a post hoc subanalysis of the multinational, multicenter, open-label Catheter Ablation vs Anti-Arrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) randomized clinical trial, for which enrollment occurred from November 2009 to April 2016, with follow-up until December 31, 2017. Individuals with AF and at least 1 stroke risk factor were recruited in the CABANA trial. Only those with complete NMRRF data were included in this secondary analysis. Data were analyzed from November 1, 2023, to May 12, 2025. EXPOSURE Patients were categorized into 2 subgroups based on their number of NMRRFs (<3 or >= 3 risk factors). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point of the CABANA trial was death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Four NMRRFs were examined: AF duration more than 1 year, persistent or long-standing persistent AF, age older than 65 years, and female sex. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models with adjustment were performed to investigate the benefit of ablation in each subgroup. RESULTS In total, 2185 patients (median age, 67.0 years [IQR, 62.0-72.0 years]; 1373 males [62.8%]) with complete NMRRF data were included. Of these patients, 1100 (50.3%) were randomized to receive catheter ablation and 1085 (49.7%) were randomized to receive drug therapy. Most patients (1469 [67.2%]) had fewer than 3 NMRRFs, while 716 (32.8%) had 3 or more. In patients with fewer than 3 NMRRFs, catheter ablation reduced the primary end point (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 0.59 [95% CI, 0.41-0.86]). However, the difference was not significant in those with 3 or more NMRRFs (AHR, 1.55 [95% CI, 0.93-2.58]). The interaction between the primary end point and the NMRRF category was significant (P for interaction = .003). Across all NMRRF groups, ablation did not reduce all-cause mortality (<3 NMRRFs: AHR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.41-1.02] and >= 3 NMRRFs: AHR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.66-2.33]) but decreased AF recurrence (<3 NMRRFs: AHR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.40-0.52] and >= 3 NMRRFs: AHR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.69]) and improved quality of life throughout follow-up for symptom frequency (<3 NMRRFs: -1.63 [95% CI, -2.18 to -1.07] and >= 3 NMRRFs: -1.15 [95% CI, -1.98 to -0.31]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this secondary analysis of the CABANA randomized clinical trial, the findings suggest that catheter ablation yielded significant cardiovascular benefits in patients with AF with fewer than 3 NMRRFs compared with drug therapy.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Psychotic symptoms in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and heart valve operation,"Objective: Delirium on internal medicine and surgical wards of the general hospital is associated with several predisposing and precipitating factors as well as adverse outcomes. Whether psychosis, the symptom of delirium that may be recognized most promptly, is similarly associated with these factors and outcomes is largely unknown. Methods: Eight thousand one hundred and thirty-nine consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and/or heart valve operation were screened for preoperative predisposing factors and postoperative psychotic symptoms between January 1999 and July 2004. Data on per- and postoperative precipitating factors were collected in 4942 patients enrolled between January 2001 and July 2004. Data were examined using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios. Results: The rate of severe psychotic symptoms was 2.1 % (n = 168). Higher age, renal failure, dyspnoea, heart failure, and left ventricle hypertrophy were independent preoperative predisposing factors. Peroperative hypothermia (< 33 degrees C), hypoxemia, low hematocrit, renal failure, increased sodium, infection and stroke were independent precipitating factors. Psychotic symptoms were independently associated with a prolonged length of stay on the intensive care unit (odds ratio 7.8; 95% confidence interval 5.6-11), multi-organ failure or shock (3.2; 95% CI: 2.2-4.9), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (3.6; 95% CI: 2.1-6.2), and in-hospital death after surgery (2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4.1). Conclusions: Psychotic symptoms are independently associated with several chronic and peroperative problems (including mild hypothermia during surgery), closely resembling those for delirium (with and without psychotic symptoms). Psychotic symptoms are also independently associated with adverse outcomes. Prompt diagnostic and therapeutic intervention aimed at the underlying problem may improve outcomes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

There were no statistically significant differences in defibrillation using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) when comparing the pandemic period with the prepandemic period (5.0% vs. 6.2%; OR=0.78; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.07; p=0.12). Conclusion: The data indicate a substantial decrease in the activation of PAD during the pandemic. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant variations in the usage of shock using AEDs, suggesting that the use of AEDs remained similar to that in the pre-pandemic periods when they were available.

Methods We analyzed data from Catheter Ablation vs. Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation (CABANA) trial, which assessed whether catheter ablation was more effective than drugs for improving outcomes in AF patients, including paroxysmal, persistent and long-standing persistent AF. In this study, patients were stratified by whether they had pharmacological or direct current cardioversion (P/DCCV) before randomization. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest.The secondary outcomes included all-cause death, death or cardiovascular hospitalization, cardiovascular death, AF recurrence and composite of all-cause death, stroke, or cardiovascular hospitalization. Results In CABANA trial, 1,035 (47.0%) had a history of P/DCCV.The effect of catheter ablation on primary outcome did not differ significantly between patients with prior P/DCCV and those without (HR = 1.00, 95%CI [0.66-1.51] and HR = 0.68, 95%CI [0.45-1.03], respectively). For the secondary outcome of death or cardiovascular hospitalization, catheter ablation reduced risk in both groups, with a greater effect observed in patients with prior P/DCCV (HR = 0.72, 95%CI [0.61-0.85] vs. HR = 0.91, 95%CI [0.78-1.07], respectively; P for interaction = 0.032).

The objectives of the study were to determine the mortality rates, length of stay, and indicators of poor outcomes in nonagenarian patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Data were retrospectively collected from a single-centre university hospital in Australia over a 10-year period. Cox regression survival analysis, hazard ratios (HRs) and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess characteristics and associated survival. A total of 25,766 adult patients were admitted to the intensive care unit during the study period, of whom 89 (0.35%) were nonagenarians. The intensive care unit and hospital mortality rates of nonagenarians were 10.1% and 22.5%, respectively. The Australian and New Zealand risk of death model was the most significant predictor of mortality among the risk scoring systems. Nonagenarians who experienced a cardiac arrest had the highest hazard of death in the intensive care unit (HR 7.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 38.66, P = 0.015) and throughout their hospital admission (HR 6.77, 95% CI 1.52 to 30.28, P = 0.012). Acute renal failure and invasive ventilation had a significantly increased hazard of death in the intensive care unit and hospital admission. Lactate levels also demonstrated a significant increase in the hazard of death per 1 mmol/l increase (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.08, P < 0.001). Over the study follow-up period of a minimum of 3.5 years, 50 of 89 patients (56.2%) died.

Congestive heart failure was predominant in all patients at the time of diagnosis, 73% of whom were in Functional Class III or IV. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure averaged 23.8 .+-. 0.8 mm Hg (mean .+-. standard error of the mean), total ejection fraction 29.7% .+-. 1.0%, and telediastolic volume of the aneurysm 76.2 .+-. 5.8 ml. Aneurysmectomy was performed in 49  patients (45%), whereas the remaining 60 patients were treated medically. The two groups did not differ in regard to clinical and hemodynamic data on admission, except for a more extensive coronary artery disease in the surgical group. Follow-up was obtained fro all patients (100%) and averaged 48 .+-. 3 months. Actuarial survival curves were similar, and the 5-year survival rates for surgical and medical groups were 70 .+-. 7% and 64% .+-. 7%, respectively (not significant). However, the 5-year complication-free rate was significantly (p = 0.05) higher among surgical patients (52% .+-. 8%) than among the medical group (31% .+-. 7%). Multivariate analysis showed the following variables to influence survival independently (p < 0.05): contractile segment ejection fraction, right ventricular failure, antecedents of cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock, and corrected contractile score. Independent variables decreasing the risk of cardiac-related complications and death (p < 0.05) were as follows: surgical treatment, shorter interval between initial infarction and diagnosis of aneurysm, and absence of right ventricular failure. Functional improvement was directly related to surgical treatment and to residual segment contractile score (p < 0.05).

A Protocol for the REDUSE Randomized Clinical Trial,"In septic shock, administration of large fluid volumes is associated with poor outcomes. Recent evidence shows that non-resuscitation fluids are the major modifiable source of fluids for patients with septic shock in intensive care units (ICUs). This clinical trial is designed to test the hypothesis that restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids improves outcomes compared to usual care. Adult patients admitted to ICUs with septic shock will be randomly assigned within 12 h of admission to receive protocolized restrictive administration of non-resuscitation fluids or usual care. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality at 90 days. Secondary outcomes are complications during ICU stay up to 90 days (defined as any acute kidney injury or cerebral, coronary, intestinal, or limb ischemia), mechanical ventilation free days within 90 days, and for survivors cognitive function (by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MOCA-BLIND]) and Health-Related Quality of Life (by the EQ Visual Analogue Scale [EQ-VAS]), both at 6 months.

Consequently, a major focus of emergency medical services (EMS) systems and pre -hospital medicine has been improving the time until medical intervention in these time-sensitive emergencies, often by reducing the time required to deliver critical medical supplies to the scene of the emergency. Medical indications for using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are rapidly expanding, including the delivery of time-sensitive medical supplies. To date, the drone-based delivery of a variety of time-critical medical supplies has been evaluated, generating promising data suggesting that drones can improve the time interval to intervention through the rapid delivery of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs), naloxone, antiepileptics, and blood products. Furthermore, the improvement in the time until intervention offered by drones in out-of-hospital emergencies is likely to improve patient outcomes in time-dependent medical emergencies. However, barriers and knowledge gaps remain that must be addressed. Further research demonstrating functionality in real-world scenarios, as well as research that integrates drones into the existing EMS structure will be necessary before drones can reach their full potential.

In such cases, Bayesian response-adaptive randomization (BRAR) is often considered because it can alter the allocation ratio throughout the trial in favor of the treatment that is currently performing better. Although previous studies have recommended using fixed randomization over BRAR based on patient benefit metrics calculated from the realized trial sample size, these previous comparisons have been limited by failures to hold type I and II error rates constant across designs or consider the impacts on all individuals directly affected by the design choice. In this paper, we propose a metric for comparing designs with the same type I and II error rates that reflects expected outcomes among individuals who would participate in the trial if enrollment is open when they become eligible. We demonstrate how to use the proposed metric to guide the choice of design in the context of two recent trials in persons suffering out of hospital cardiac arrest.

This narrative review aims to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting neurological outcomes postcardiac resuscitation. The methodology involved a detailed review of all relevant recent studies of AI, different machine learning algorithms, prediction tools, and assessing their benefit in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases as compared to more traditional prognostic scoring systems and tools. Previously, outcome determining clinical, blood, and radiological factors were prone to other influencing factors like limited accuracy and time constraints. Studies conducted also emphasized that to predict poor neurological outcomes, a more multimodal approach helped adjust for confounding factors, interpret diverse datasets, and provide a reliable prognosis, which only demonstrates the need for AI to help overcome challenges faced. Advanced machine learning algorithms like artificial neural networks (ANN) using supervised learning by AI have improved the accuracy of prognostic models outperforming conventional models. Several real-world cases of effective AI-powered algorithm models have been cited here. Studies comparing machine learning tools like XGBoost, AI Watson, hyperspectral imaging, ChatGPT-4, and AI-based gradient boosting have noted their beneficial uses. AI could help reduce workload, healthcare costs, and help personalize care, process vast genetic and lifestyle data and help reduce side effects from treatments. Limitations of AI have been covered extensively in this article, including data quality, bias, privacy issues, and transparency. Our objectives should be to use more diverse data sources, use interpretable data output giving process explanation, validation method, and implement policies to safeguard patient data. Despite the limitations, the advancements already made by AI and its potential in predicting neurological outcomes in postcardiac resuscitation cases has been quite promising and boosts a continually improving system, albeit requiring close human supervision with training and improving models, with plans to educate clinicians, the public and sharing collected data.",ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY,2024,"Khawar, MM; Saboor, HA; Eric, R; Arain, NR; Bano, S; Abaker, MBM; Siddiqui, BI; Figueroa, RR; Koppula, SR; Fatima, H; Begum, A; Anwar, S; Khalid, MU; Jamil, U; Iqbal, J",10.1097/MS9.0000000000002673,,WOS:001373785000021,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Evaluating paramedic comfort with field pronouncement: Development and validation of an outcome measure,"Objectives: Interventions designed to improve cardiac resuscitation and the quality of field pronouncement need to consider outcomes on paramedic providers. The authors developed and evaluated the reliability and validity of a survey instrument measuring paramedic comfort with field pronouncement. Methods: A mail survey of 120 paramedics (EMT-Ps) was performed using the Modified Dillman survey methodology. Questions were sorted for analysis into subgroups assessing psychological comfort and technical skills. Sixty-five respondents were retested within two weeks. Results: The overall response rate was 96% (115). Respondents had an average age of 36 years (SD +/- 5), with 5.2 years (SD +/- 3.8) of out-of-hospital experience as an EMT-P, and were involved in a median of ten field pronouncements annually (range = 2-60). The face and content validity of the survey instrument was consistent with a content matrix derived by a focus group. The Cronbach's alpha for the survey instrument was 0.91. The retest response rate was 76% (46). The test-retest reliability coefficient was 0.84. Conclusions: This survey is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the paramedic psychological comfort with field pronouncement. The high response rate and intrareliability support its generalizability.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is felt to be the most common etiology. Although smoking is a prominent risk factor for CAD, there is a paucity of data assessing the direct effect of smoking on third-degree AV block. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study on adult -weighted admissions in 2019 -2020 with a primary diagnosis of third-degree AV block and a history of smoking using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. In -hospital mortality, rates of pacemaker insertion, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury (AKI), stroke, tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, mechanical circulatory support, vasopressor use, length of stay (LOS), and total hospitalization costs were analyzed using regression analysis. We performed a secondary analysis using propensity score matching to confirm the results. Results: A total of 77,650 admissions met inclusion criteria (33,625 females [43.3 %], 58,315.

There is a question whether IO-administered epinephrine is equivalent to intravenously administered epinephrine during CA. Methods: The question guiding this evidence-based review was as follows: in adults suffering CA given epinephrine via the IO route, what is the resulting serum concentration of the drug compared to when administered intravenously? A search was conducted and the evidence appraised and leveled. Results: Four animal studies met the inclusion criteria. The sources showed no definitive evidence supporting equivalence between intravenous and IO epinephrine administered during CA. Intravenously administered epinephrine provides increased and faster appearing serum concentrations than IO-administered epinephrine. Evidence indicated epinephrine given via the sternal IO route more closely approaches equivalence with intravenously administered epinephrine than when administered by the tibial IO route. Conclusions: The clinician should consider using proximal IO infusion sites such as the sternum or humerus when administering advanced cardiac life support drugs to rapidly achieve maximal therapeutic concentrations.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The Use of Amantadine in Treating Extrapyramidal Symptoms in Organophosphates Poisoning in a Child,"Background. Organophosphates are chemicals that lead to the accumulation of acetylcholine, causing muscarinic symptoms such as salivation and nicotinic manifestations like muscle weakness and hypertension and rarely leading to basal ganglia impairment, manifesting as extrapyramidal symptoms. Literature reported that the use of amantadine, an amine that has both antiviral and dopaminergic activities, improves extrapyramidal manifestations. Most of the studies exploring the effect of amantadine were conducted on adults and there are extremely limited data in regards to this topic in Saudi Arabia. Thus, the purpose of this case study is to report the outcome of treating a child who developed extrapyramidal symptoms due to organophosphates poisoning with amantadine. Case Description. A 6-year-old boy was found by his family drowsy and drooling with an insecticide bottle beside him. He was brought to the ER and arrested on arrival, and he was eventually revived after 5 minutes of CPR. Then, he developed features of extrapyramidal involvement such as delirium, hyperactivity, akathisia, aphonia, and tremors. He was started on oral amantadine 50 mg once daily and then increased to twice daily for two weeks while admitted. During admission, his symptoms were assessed daily, and an improvement was noticed by his family and the medical team. Upon discharge, he was able to form sentences; tremors were almost resolved; and there was no rigidity or agitation. He was followed up postdischarge and showed significant improvement. He continued amantadine for almost 3 months until the full resolution of his symptoms. Discussion and Conclusion. This case illustrates the promising benefits of using amantadine in treating extrapyramidal manifestations following organophosphate ingestion.",CASE REPORTS IN PEDIATRICS,2023,"Althaqafi, W; Alanazi, RI; Almeshari, WK",10.1155/2023/1632052,,WOS:001069287800001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Stereological assessment of the blood-air barrier and the surfactant system after mesenchymal stem cell pretreatment in a porcine non-heart-beating donor model for lung transplantation,"More frequent utilization of non-heart-beating donor (NHBD) organs for lung transplantation has the potential to relieve the shortage of donor organs. In particular with respect to uncontrolled NHBD, concerns exist regarding the risk of ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) injury-related graft damage or dysfunction. Due to their immunomodulating and tissue-remodelling properties, bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been suspected of playing a beneficial role regarding short- and long-term survival and function of the allograft. Thus, MSC administration might represent a promising pretreatment strategy for NHBD organs. To study the initial effects of warm ischaemia and MSC application, a large animal lung transplantation model was generated, and the structural organ composition of the transplanted lungs was analysed stereologically with particular respect to the blood-gas barrier and the surfactant system. In this study, porcine lungs (n = 5/group) were analysed. Group 1 was the sham-operated control group. In pigs of groups 2-4, cardiac arrest was induced, followed by a period of 3 h of ventilated ischaemia at room temperature. In groups 3 and 4, 50 x 10(6) MSCs were administered intravascularly via the pulmonary artery and endobronchially, respectively, during the last 10 min of ischaemia. The left lungs were transplanted, followed by a reperfusion period of 4 h. Then, lungs were perfusion-fixed and processed for light and electron microscopy. Samples were analysed stereologically for IR injury-related structural parameters, including volume densities and absolute volumes of parenchyma components, alveolar septum components, intra-alveolar oedema, and the intracellular and intra-alveolar surfactant pool. Additionally, the volume-weighted mean volume of lamellar bodies (lbs) and their profile size distribution were determined. Three hours of ventilated warm ischaemia was tolerated without eliciting histological or ultrastructural signs of IR injury, as revealed by qualitative and quantitative assessment. However, warm ischaemia influenced the surfactant system. The volume-weighted mean volume of lbs was reduced significantly (P = 0.024) in groups subjected to ischaemia (group medians of groups 2-4: 0.180-0.373 mu m(3)) compared with the sham control group (median 0.814 mu m(3)). This was due to a lower number of large lb profiles (size classes 5-15). In contrast, the intra-alveolar surfactant system was not altered significantly. No significant differences were encountered comparing ischaemia alone (group 2) or ischaemia plus application of MSCs (groups 3 and 4) in this short-term model.",JOURNAL OF ANATOMY,2018,"Schnapper, A; Christmann, A; Knudsen, L; Rahmanian, P; Choi, YN; Zeriouh, M; Karavidic, S; Neef, K; Sterner-Kock, A; Guschlbauer, M; Hofmaier, F; Maul, AC; Wittwer, T; Wahlers, T; Mühlfeld, C; Ochs, M",10.1111/joa.12747,,WOS:000425850800010,A

While common causes include microscopic colitis, bile acid diarrhoea, and laxative use, rarer aetiologies such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-secreting neuroendocrine tumours (VIPomas) must be considered when standard investigations fail.Case PresentationWe present a 35-year-old woman with a two-year history of progressively worsening, fasting-persistent, high-volume watery diarrhoea leading to severe electrolyte abnormalities and weight loss requiring resuscitation in intensive care. Extensive biochemical, endoscopic, and radiological investigations-including faecal analysis, colonoscopy, neuroendocrine markers, multiphase CT, endoscopic ultrasound, and Ga-68 Dotatate PET imaging-failed to identify an underlying cause. Serum VIP levels remained within the normal range. Despite the absence of a definitive diagnosis, empirical treatment with the somatostatin analogue octreotide led to rapid and sustained symptom resolution. The patient was subsequently maintained on long-acting lanreotide with complete remission. Notably, diarrhoea recurred upon cessation of therapy, again resolving with reinitiation. After 4 years, the patient self-ceased lanreotide without symptom recurrence, and follow-up imaging remained unremarkable.DiscussionThis case highlights a diagnostic dilemma: clinical and biochemical features were highly suggestive of a VIPoma, yet no tumour was identified despite repeated advanced imaging and biochemical workup. The patient's remarkable therapeutic response to somatostatin analogue therapy, in the absence of confirmed neuroendocrine neoplasia, suggests that somatostatin analogues may have a broader role in the management of idiopathic secretory diarrhoea than currently appreciated.ConclusionWe present a rare case of chronic secretory diarrhoea with suspected but unproven VIPoma, demonstrating sustained and reproducible response to somatostatin analogue therapy.

Data Sources: Systematic literature search of Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsychInfo. Study Selection: Two reviewers identified peer-reviewed published articles with the following criteria: 1) published between January 1, 1980, and August 1, 2018; 2) published in English; 3) study population of parents of children with a PICU admission; and 4) quantitative studies examining factors associated with outcomes of parent mental health, parent physical health, or family functioning. Data Extraction: Literature search yielded 2,476 articles, of which 23 studies met inclusion criteria. Study data extracted included study characteristics, descriptive statistics of parent outcomes after critical illness, and variables associated with parent and family outcomes. Data Synthesis: Studies examined numerous variables associated with parent and family outcomes and used multiple survey measures. These variables were categorized according to their phase in the Integrative Trajectory Model of Pediatric Medical Traumatic Stress, which included peri-trauma, acute medical care, and ongoing care or discharge from care. The majority of objective elements of a child's illness, such as severity of illness and length of hospitalization, did not have a clear relationship with parent and family outcomes. However, familial preexisting factors, a parent's subjective experience in the PICU, and family life stressors after discharge were often associated with parent and family outcomes. Conclusions: This systematic literature review suggests that parent and family outcomes after pediatric critical illness are impacted by familial preexisting factors, a parent's subjective experience in the PICU, and family life stressors after discharge.

However, data from earlier generation cohorts who were born in substantially different eras of neonatal intensive care cannot be relied on to predict outcome of today's newborn. Our review by the crucial variable of birth cohort year shows a changing developmental trajectory in which today's extremely preterm survivor is likely to have fewer severe medical complications, better neurological outcomes, and fewer adverse cognitive late effects. Such data further underscore the importance of concurrently considering medical, familial, socioenvironmental, and neurobiological factors in combination with individual neonatal intensive care center protocols when studying outcomes of the preterm child.

This represents a highly promising development in the field of neurocritical care. This review discusses the place of mild therapeutic hypothermia in the overall therapeutic strategy for cardiac arrest patients. Cooling should not be viewed in isolation but in the context of a 'treatment bundle,' which together can significantly improve outcome after cardiac arrest. Favourable outcomes of 50-60% are now routinely achieved in many centres in patients with witnessed arrest and an initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. These results have been achieved by combining a number of therapeutic strategies, including early and effective resuscitation with greater emphasis on continuing chest compressions throughout various procedures (including resumption of compressions immediately after defibrillation even if rhythm has been restored) as well as prevention of hypoxia and hypotension in all stages following restoration of spontaneous circulation. Regarding the use of hypothermia, early induction and proper management of side-effects are the key elements of successful implementation. Treatment should include the rapid infusion of 1500-3000 mL of cold fluids to induce hypothermia and prevent hypovolaemia and hypotension.

As part of that effort, a paper-based Burn Flow Sheet (BFS) was included to document the burn resuscitation of combat casualties with >= 20% total body surface area burns. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the BFS in terms of ongoing utilization, resuscitation management, and outcomes of patients transported. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was performed of hard-copy BFSs received from January 2007 to December 2013. En route injury and treatment data from these flowsheets were manually transcribed into the research database. Outcomes and complications of BFS subjects were extracted from the Burn Center Registry and added to the research database. Results: A total of 73 BFSs were collected from the study period. On average, BFSs were 61 +/- 30% complete with a total of 14.7 +/- 7 hours documented per patient in the first 24-hours postburn. Patients received nearly 7 L more fluid than estimated by traditional formulas. Sixteen patients (26%) received greater than 250 mL/kg of fluid, half of whom had concomitant traumatic injuries. Fifteen patients received a fasciotomy (21%), 4 received a laparotomy (5%), and 8 (11%) received both. No patients developed abdominal compartment syndrome associated with fluid resuscitation. Overall mortality was 21%. Conclusions: Although the majority of providers did initiate a BFS, it was not always used as intended; problems included missing data and miscalculations. Although there was a clear improvement with decline in the incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome, mortality did not change for severely burned patients.

Herein a hemostatic hybrid hydrogel comprised of hyaluronic acid and polyethylene glycol stabilized by thiourea-catechol coupling and disulfide bonds is reported. The hybrid hydrogels exhibit enhanced mechanical properties, short gelation time, and good blood clotting ability compared with fibrin gels. The in vivo hemostatic efficacy is confirmed in a rat model of arterial bleeding, in which the rapid gelation of hybrid hydrogels after topical application effectively arrests blood loss with no rebleeding occurring during resuscitation when blood pressure approximately recovers to normal. A large animal study further demonstrates the efficacy of hybrid hydrogels to achieve endoscopic hemostasis against upper GI hemorrhage in pigs. Follow-up observations show that the hybrid hydrogels can remain adherent at the bleeding wound for 48 h, indicating the sustained hemostatic function in vivo. Collectively, this work demonstrates a promising hemostatic hydrogel for endoscopic hemostasis in upper GI hemorrhage.",ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS,2022,"Xia, XF; Xu, XY; Wang, B; Zhou, D; Zhang, WL; Xie, X; Lai, HS; Xue, J; Rai, A; Li, Z; Peng, X; Zhao, PC; Bian, LM; Chiu, PWY",10.1002/adfm.202109332,,WOS:000736703100001,A

ObjectiveThis study aimed to compare trauma types and injury characteristics, vital signs, and outcomes in patients with and without IRBV (nIRBV) and examine whether IRBV and pre-existing renal dysfunction affected the likelihood of in-hospital renal complications (iHRC). Materials and MethodsAfter identifying penetrating and blunt trauma victims with IRBV in the National Trauma Data Bank, patient demographics, injury-related variables, treatment outcomes, and deaths under care were analyzed and compared. ResultsOf the 994,184 trauma victims, 610 (0.6%) experienced IRBV. Victims in the IRBV group (IRBVG) had a significantly higher frequency of penetrating injuries (19.5% vs. 9.2%, P < 0.001) and higher injury severity score (ISS >= 25, 61.5% vs. 6.7%). Most injuries in both groups were unintentional, although a higher frequency of assault was noted in the IRBVG. The incidence of iHRC was higher in the IRBVG (6.6%) than in the nIRBVG (0.4%; P < 0.001). The IRBV {OR = 3.5 [95% CI = (2.4-5.0)]}, preexisting renal disorders {OR = 2.5 [95% CI = (2.1-2.9)]}, and in-hospital cardiac arrest {OR = 8.6 [95% CI = (7.7-9.5)]} were found to be among the factors associated with a higher risk of iHRC. ConclusionsIRBV and pre-existing renal disorders considerably increased the risk of developing iHRC.

We performed the limiting dilution method with culture filtrate supplementation of liquid media in pre- and post-treatment sputum samples to assess the bacillary load and to evaluate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulation dynamics within the 6-months standard anti-tuberculosis regimen. We found that supplementation increased the bacillary load by 30% in pre-treatment samples (p = 0.0005) and 35% in samples after one month of treatment (p = 0.0977). We found a weak linear correlation between the decrease of Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth in liquid media with and without culture filtrate supplementation (rho = 0.54; p = 0.026). None of the patients had bacilli recovery after two months of treatment. Our study constitutes the first follow-up regarding Mycobacterium tuberculosis subpopulation dynamics throughout a standard 6-month anti-tuberculosis treatment and also supports the use of culture filtrate to increase bacillary load in liquid media.

We predict that most shark attacks are nonfatal but require skilled, timely medical intervention. The development of a shark bite severity scoring scale will assist communication and understanding of such an injury. We retrospectively reviewed records of the prospectively maintained International Shark Attack File (ISAF) at the University of Florida. The ISAF contains 4409 investigations, including 2979 documented attacks, 96 of which have complete medical records. We developed a Shark-Induced Trauma (SIT) Scale and calculated the level of injury for each attack. Medical records were reviewed for the 96 documented shark attack victims since 1921. Calculated levels of injury in the SIT Scale reveal 40 Level 1 injuries (41.7%), 16 Level 2 injuries (16.7%), 18 Level 3 injuries (18.8%), 14 Level 4 injuries (14.6%), and eight Level 5 injuries (8.3%). The overall mortality of shark attacks was 8.3 per cent. However, SIT Scale Level I injuries comprised the greatest percentage of cases at 41.7 per cent.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Disparities in cardiovascular disease and treatment in the Nordic countries,"The Nordic countries, inc luding Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden have seen a steep decline in cardiovascular mortality in recent decades. They are among the most egalitarian countries by several measures, and all have universal, publicly funded welfare systems providing healthcare for all citizens. However, despite these seemingly ideal conditions, disparities in access to cardiovascular care and outcomes persist. To address this challenge, The Lancet Region Health-Europe convened experts from a broad range of countries to sum-ma rize the current state of knowledge on cardiovascular disease disparities across Europe. This Series Paper presents the main challenges in Nordic countries based on evidence from high-quality nationwide registries. Focusing on major cardiovascular health determinants, areas in need of improvement were identified. There is a need for addressing structural causes underlying these disparities, such as poverty and discrimination, but also to improve access to healthcare in deprived neighborhoods and to address underlying social determinants of health that may mitigate disparities in cardiovascular outcomes. Overall, while the Nordic countries have made great strides in promoting egalitarianism and providing universal healthcare, there is still much work to be done to ensure equitable access to care and improved cardiovascular outcomes for all members of society.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Association between comorbidity burden and outcomes of catheter ablation vs. medical therapy for atrial fibrillation: insights from the CABANA trial,"Aims Multimorbidity frequently coexists with atrial fibrillation (AF) and complicates treatment decisions. While current guidelines offer selective recommendations for catheter ablation in this group, evidence remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate whether comorbidity burden modifies the effectiveness of catheter ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drug therapy.Methods and results In this post hoc analysis of the CABANA trial, patients were stratified by overall comorbidity burden using a data-driven threshold based on the distribution of 15 pre-specified conditions. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular hospitalization and a composite of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization. Additional outcomes included AF recurrence and AF-related quality of life in a sub-cohort. Of 2204 patients, 736 had high comorbidity burden {>= 4 conditions, based on a data-driven threshold; median age 68.0 [interquartile range (IQR): 63.0-73.0], 67.1% male} and 1468 had low burden [median age 67.0 (IQR: 61.0-71.0), 60.7% male]. Over a median follow-up of 3.9 years (IQR: 2.4-5.1), for the primary outcome, the adjusted hazard ratio for catheter ablation vs. drug therapy was 0.62 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.42-0.93] in patients with high comorbidity burden and 1.16 (95% CI: 0.76-1.77) in those with low burden (interaction P = 0.038). Secondary outcomes also tended to favour ablation in the high comorbidity burden group. Moreover, catheter ablation significantly reduced AF recurrence, with relative risk reductions of 49% and 40% in the low- and high-burden groups, respectively. Furthermore, catheter ablation improved AF-related quality of life in both comorbidity groups, with more sustained and pronounced benefits over time in patients with high comorbidity burden.Conclusion Catheter ablation was associated with more favourable clinical outcomes in AF patients with high comorbidity burden, which support broader consideration of ablation in this population, though prospective trials are needed to confirm and guide clinical decision-making in personalized rhythm management.Pre-registered clinical trial number NCT00911508",EUROPACE,2025,"Chen, Y; Soler-Espejo, E; Zhao, ML; Li, WH; Liu, HY; Gue, Y; McDowell, G; Packer, DL; Lip, GYH",10.1093/europace/euaf292,,WOS:001630410100001,A

One of the most widely used is Clinical Frailty Scale, wrecently adapted to Spanish (CFS-Spain). Objective: To evaluate the validity and sensitivity to change of the CFS-Espa & ntilde;a in a cohort of critically ill patients aged >= 18 years. Methodology: A prospective, multicenter, observational, metric-based study was conducted between January-2020 and July-2024. Adult patients with ICU stays >48 hours were included. Follow-up was performed during the stay and up to one year after discharge. Variables: frailty, sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life, comorbidities, severity (SAPS3), ICU outcome variables, length of stay, and discharge destination. Statistical analysis: exploratory, bivariate regression to assess the relationship between frailty and the recorded variables; multivariate regression of significant variables in bivariate. Spearman correlation of CFS-Spain with quantitative variables. Comparison of means with Student's t-test for sensitivity to change. Results: A total of 493 patients were included, 17.4% of whom were frail (CFS-Spain = 5-9). Age, being female, and being dependent increased the risk of frailty, as did previous hospitalizations, comorbidities, poorer physical quality of life, low academic level, and low annual income. Frailty predicts muscle weakness, hypoglycemia, the need for extrarenal blood pressure, invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or limitation of life-sustaining treatment, and is associated with mortality. Frailty was not associated with mental quality of life, SAPS3, SOFA or ICU/hospital stay. The greatest change observed was between admission and 3 months after discharge. The effect size for changes in CFS-Es between admission, midpoints, and discharge was high (d = 0.832). Conclusions: The CFS-Spain shows good convergent validity with age, women, dependency, poorer physical quality of life, days of previous hospitalization, academic level and low annual income. Good predictive validity for the level of vital support in ICU, mortality and destination at hospital discharge. (c) 2025 The Author(s).

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The Effectiveness and Cost Effectiveness of Public-Access Defibrillation,"Many sudden cardiac deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). The use of defibrillators in hospitals or by outpatient emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can save many cardiac-arrest victims. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) permit defibrillation by trained first responders and laypersons. AEDs are available at most public venues, and vast sums of money are spent installing and maintaining these devices. AEDs have been evaluated in a variety of public and private settings. AEDs accurately identify malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and frequently result in successful defibrillation. Prompt application of an AED shows a greater number of patients in VF compared with initial rhythms documented by later-arriving EMS personnel. Survival is greatest when the AED is placed within 3 to 5 minutes of a witnessed collapse. Community-based studies show increased cardiac-arrest survival when first responders are equipped with AEDs rather than waiting for paramedics to defibrillate. Wide dissemination of AEDs throughout a community increases survival from cardiac arrest when the AED is used; however, the AEDs are utilized in a very small percentage of all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. AEDs save very few lives in residential units such as private homes or apartment complexes. AEDs are cost effective at sites where there is a high density of both potential victims and resuscitators. Placement at golf courses, health clubs, and similar venues is not cost effective; however, the visible devices are good for public awareness of the problem of sudden cardiac death and provide reassurance to patrons.",CLINICAL CARDIOLOGY,2010,"Winkle, RA",10.1002/clc.20790,,WOS:000280351800002,A

Many gaps remain, however, regarding survivors' psychosocial perceptions of life in the aftermath of cardiac arrest. An important influence upon those perceptions is the presence of support and its role in a survivor's life. An Internet-based pilot survey study was conducted to gather data from SCA survivors and friends and/or family members (FFMs) representing their support system. The survey was distributed to members of the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Foundation (SCAF) via the Internet by SCAF leadership. Questions included both discrete multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Inductive thematic analyses were completed by three independent researchers trained in qualitative research methodology to identify primary themes consistent among study participants until thematic saturation was achieved. No statistical inferences were made. A total of 205 surveys were returned over the 5-month study period (July to November 2013); nine were received blank, leaving 196 surveys available for review. Major themes identified for survivors (N=157) include the significance of and desire to share experiences with others; subculture identification (unique experience from those suffering a heart attack); and the need to seek a new normal, both personally and inter-personally. Major themes identified for FFMs (N=39) include recognition of loved one's memory loss; a lack of information at discharge, including expectations after discharge; and concern for the patient experiencing another cardiac arrest. This pilot, qualitative survey study suggests several common themes important to survivors, and FFMs, of cardiac arrest.

On the other hand, genetic testing is also important because the mutation site in the specific genes of CPVT is related to the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and gene penetrance.Case summary We present a case of a 15-year-old male with a familial history of CPVT and a history of syncope at the age of 5. He experienced a cardiac arrest prompting out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and his circulatory dynamics recovered. Multiple premature ventricular contractions inducted by a treadmill exercise test disappeared after a dosage of verapamil, flecainide, and nadolol, and a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. The novel pathogenic mutation with an insertion of histidine near the C-terminus of the RYR2 protein was identified by genetic testing in this case and his mother.Discussion The RYR2 mutation in this case has not been previously reported and may be an intractable phenotype of CPVT associated with a strong familial history and fatal cardiac events even under adequate medical therapy.",EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS,2024,"Shoji, Y; Hayashida, S; Masuda, H; Tachibana, E; Okumura, Y",10.1093/ehjcr/ytae652,,WOS:001379195900001,A

An Exploratory Study on Macro Vascular Spasm, Delayed Cerebral Infarction and Functional Outcome after Prolonged Hypothermia","Background: Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is an established treatment after cardiac arrest and growing evidence supports its use as neuroprotective treatment in stroke. Only few and heterogeneous studies exist on the effect of hypothermia in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A novel approach of early and prolonged TH and its influence on key complications in poor-grade SAH, vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) was evaluated. Methods: This observational matched controlled study included 36 poor-grade (Hunt and Hess Scale > 3 and World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies Scale > 3) SAH patients. Twelve patients received early TH (<48 h after ictus), mild (35 degrees C), prolonged (7 +/- 1 days) and were matched to 24 patients from the prospective SAH database. Vasospasm was diagnosed by angiography, macrovascular spasm serially evaluated by Doppler sonography and DCI was defined as new infarction on follow-up CT. Functional outcome was assessed at 6 months'by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and categorized as favorable (mRS score 0-2) versus unfavorable (mRS score 3-6) outcome. Results: Angiographic vasospasm was present in 71.0% of patients. TH neither influenced occurrence nor duration, but the degree of macrovascular spasm as well as peak spastic velocities were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Frequency of DCI was 87.5% in non-TH vs. 50% in TH-treated patients, translating into a relative risk reduction of 43% and preventive risk ratio of 0.33 (95% CI 0.14-0.77, p = 0.036). Favorable functional outcome was twice as frequent in TH-treated patients 66.7 vs. 33.3% of non-TH (p = 0.06). Conclusion: Early and prolonged TH was associated with a reduced degree of macrovascular spasm and significantly decreased occurrence of DCI, possibly ameliorating functional outcome. TH may represent a promising neuroprotective therapy possibly targeting multiple pathways of DCI development, notably macrovascular spasm, which strongly warrants further evaluation of its clinical impact.

However, infusion of large amounts of Hb-based material could interfere with reticuloendothelial function potentiating postresuscitation sepsis mortality. We investigated the temporal relationship between hemorrhage-resuscitation and sepsis survival. Male SD rats were subjected to hemorrhage and resuscitated with shed blood volumes of purified human hemoglobin solution (HS). Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) 24h before, 0, 24, or 72h after hemorrhage/resuscitation (H/R) and survival was monitored. In additional animals with or without Hb resuscitation, hepatic heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) gene expression and HO activity were assessed. Seven-day survival for animals resuscitated with HS prior to sepsis induction was significantly higher than other groups. Animals resuscitated with HS showed hepatic HO-1 gene expression while non-HS resuscitated animals did not. In addition, hepatic HO activity levels were significantly higher in HS resuscitated animals than non-HS resuscitated animals. In conclusion, HS resuscitation does not appear to enhance postresuscitation sepsis mortality.

We analysed data from the EVIdence based TreAtment in Heart Failure (EVITA-HF) registry. Methods EVITA-HF comprises web-based case report data on demography, diagnostic measures, adverse events and 1-year follow-up of patients hospitalized for chronic heart failure >= 3 months (CHF) and an ejection fraction <= 40%. In the present study, we focused on the outcomes of pts with and without pMI in ischaemic HFrEF. Results Between February 2009 and November 2015, a total of 2075 consecutive pts with ischaemic HFrEF were included from 16 centres in Germany. A total of 81.2% were male, and the mean age was 71 years. A total of 61.5% of the pts with ischaemic HFrEF had a history of pMI. These pts were treated less often with PCI (20.0 vs. 31.0%, p < 0.001) or CABG (3.8 vs. 7.7%, p < 0.001). They more often received an ICD (40.9 vs. 28.7%, p < 0.001), but less often a CRT-D (11.3 vs. 19.4%, p < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, pts with pMI had a greater all-cause mortality after 1 year than those without pMI (hazard ratio 1.4; 95% CI, 1.10-1.79, p = 0.007). The combined endpoint of death, resuscitation or ICD shock after 1 year was greater in patients with pMI (20.8 vs. 16.4%, p = 0.03). Mobility was more often reduced in pts with pMI (46.8% vs. 40.1%, p = 0.03), and overall health status was more frequently worse in patients with pMI than in those 12 months ago (23.1 vs. 15.9%, p = 0.01). More than a quarter of the pts with ischaemic HFrEF were anxious or depressive. Conclusion pMI in patients with CHF and ischaemic HFrEF was associated with increased mortality, increased event rates, and worsened health status. Hence, the subgroup of pts with ischaemic HFrEF and pMI is at higher risk and deserves special attention.",CLINICAL RESEARCH IN CARDIOLOGY,2025,"Heer, T; Zeymer, U; Hochadel, M; Frankenstein, L; Pauschinger, M; Hambrecht, R; Bruder, O; Boehm, M; Maier, LS; Zahn, R; Senges, J",10.1007/s00392-024-02455-w,,WOS:001216080800001,A

Therapeutic options to support children with septic shock refractory to initial resuscitation with fluids and inotropes are limited. Recently, the combination of intravenous hydrocortisone with high dose ascorbic acid and thiamine (HAT therapy), postulated to reduce sepsis-related organ dysfunction, has been proposed as a safe approach with potential for mortality benefit, but randomized trials in paediatric patients are lacking. We hypothesize that protocolised early use of HAT therapy (""metabolic resuscitation"") in children with septic shock is feasible and will lead to earlier resolution of organ dysfunction.

Clinicians recognize the importance of eliciting patient preferences for life-sustaining care, yet little is known about the stability of those preferences for patients with serious disease. Objectives. To examine the stability of preferences for life-sustaining care among persons with AIDS and to assess factors associated with changes in preferences. Design. Two patient surveys and medical record reviews, administered four months apart in 1990-1991. Setting. Three health care settings in Boston. Patients. 252 of 505 eligible persons with AIDS who participated in both baseline and follow-up surveys. Main outcome measures. A single question assessing desire for cardiac resuscitation and a scale of preferences for life-extending treatment conditional on hypothetical health states. Results. Approximately one-fourth of the respondents changed their minds about life-sustaining care during a four-month period. Of patients who initially desired cardiac resuscitation, 23% decided to forego it four months later, and of those who initially said they would decline care, 34% later said they would accept it. Of those who initially desired any of the life-extending treatments, 25% decided to forego them four months later, and of those who initially said they would decline life-extending care, 24% later said they would accept some treatment. Patients reporting changes in physical function, pain, or suicide ideation were more likely to modify their desires to be resuscitated (all p less than or equal to 0.05). Patients lacking an advance directive, not completing high school, or becoming more severely ill were more likely to change their preferences on the Life Extension scale (p less than or equal to 0.05). Patients who discussed their preferences with at least one physician were just as likely as others to change desires for cardiac resuscitation. Age, gender, race, emotional health, clinical severity, social support, and site of care were not significant correlates of change for either measure. Conclusions. Health care providers should periodically reassess preferences for life-sustaining care, particularly for patients with progressive disease, given the instability in patient preferences. However, predictors of instability may vary with how preferences are measured. In particular, changes in health status may be related to instability of preferences for certain types of treatments.",MEDICAL DECISION MAKING,1999,"Weissman, JS; Haas, JS; Fowler, FJ Jr; Gatsonis, C; Massagli, MP; Seage, GR III; Cleary, P",10.1177/0272989X9901900103,,WOS:000077978800003,A

Serious morbidity follows for many of the survivors and up to 16% of patients achieving restoration of spontaneous circulation develop brain death. Other survivors are left with persistent cognitive impairment such as memory and sensimotor deficits, reducing quality of life and resulting in heavy costs on society. Many studies over the years have been devoted to improving outcome after cardiac arrest and have, to a certain degree succeeded, especially locally in areas where improvement of ambulance organizations have been effective. In spite of this serious problems remain and the chances of cerebral survival need to increase if over-all results, i.e. survival as well as cognitive function, are to improve. Methylene blue, a textile dye synthesized in the late 19th century has also been used in medicine for different purposes.

However, a complete investigation of GWR in whole lobes, quantitative cistern size, and comprehensive comparison of various brain CT parameters has not been conducted. This study aimed to comprehensively compare various early brain CT parameters along with conventional significant variables in relation to poor neurological outcome and diffuse cortical necrosis.Methods: This retrospective study included 86 adult patients with cardiac arrest who underwent brain CT/MRI. GWRs, the distance of the posterior ambient cistern, and ONSD in early brain CT and regions of interest (ROIs) in brain MRI were measured and analyzed along with clinical characteristics.Results: ROIs in the putamen and parietal white matter showed significant differences (p = 0.05, p = 0.022, respectively). The distance of the posterior ambient cistern and the GWR of the putamen and parietal white matter were newly developed predictors that were not used previously and demonstrated a significant correlation with the presence of diffuse cortical necrosis (OR 0.4, p = 0.006, AUC 0.637; OR 0.478, p = 0.02, AUC 0.603, respectively) or poor neurological outcomes (AUC 0.637, AUC 0.603, respectively), but were not more significant than pupil reflex (OR 0.06, p < 0.001). ONSD was not significantly associated with the outcomes.Conclusions: Quantitative cistern effacement and reduced GWR of the putamen and parietal white matter in early brain CT measurements of cardiac arrest patients were promising predictors in early brain CT for prognostication, but compared with clinical characteristics, the clinical significance of the CT predictors was not considerable.

Women allocated to electronic fetal heart monitoring had shorter labors and received less analgesia. The cesarean delivery rates were 2.4% for electronic fetal heart monitoring and 2.2% for intermittent auscultation but this small difference arose from the identification of nearly twice as many fetuses with low scalp pH (< 7.20) in the electronic fetal heart monitoring group. The forceps delivery rate was 8.2% in the electronic fetal heart monitoring group compared with 6.3% in the intermittent auscultation group; this excess was explained by more instrumental deliveries prompted by fetal heart rate abnormalities. There were 14 stillbirths and neonatal deaths in each group, with a similar distribution of causes. There were no apparent differences in the rates of low Apgar scores, need for resuscitation, or transfer to the special care nursery. Cases of neonatal seizures and persistent abnormal neurological signs followed by survival were twice as frequent in the intermittent auscultation group; this differential effect was related to duration of labor.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Identifying organ donors attended by prehospital healthcare professionals - A scoping review,"Introduction: Organ donation is a life-saving intervention that provides hope for patients with end-stage organ failure, improving their longevity and quality of life. However, the demand for organs far exceeds the supply, leading to a significant disparity between patients on transplant waiting lists and the availability of suitable organs. To address this issue, innovative strategies, such as uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCD) programs, have been proposed to expand the donor pool to the prehospital setting. Aim: This study aimed to systematically map the literature and comprehensively evaluate the involvement of prehospital healthcare professionals in identifying potential organ donors, as well as the barriers and systems impacting this process. Methods: A scoping literature review was conducted guided by the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. Four electronic databases and grey literature were searched for articles examining the participation of prehospital healthcare professionals in the organ or tissue donation process. Relevant data were extracted, organised into narrative and tabular formats, and presented. Results: A total of 33 articles were included for analysis, predominantly focusing on uDCD programs. The review identified a limited evidence-base regarding the role of prehospital healthcare professionals in organ donation. Four common themes emerged: discrepancies in criteria, decision-making processes, bridging strategies, and ethical considerations. Conclusion: This scoping literature review highlights the significant role of prehospital healthcare professionals in identifying and recruiting organ donors from non-traditional settings. Established uDCD systems show promise in alleviating the burden on transplant waitlists. However, there is a lack of consensus on enrolment criteria, transportation, and ethical considerations for uDCD.

A life-threatening lower gastrointestinal bleeding from mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix is a rare occurrence. Diagnosing and management of such a condition are challenging. Case Presentation. A 73-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with intermittent per rectal bleeding for two weeks, which progressed to the passage of a large number of blood clots and fresh blood. He had features of class III shock on admission. An endoscopic evaluation followed initial resuscitation to locate the source of bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed a large blood clot at the opening of the appendicular orifice with no active bleeding. Oesophagoduodenoscopy, contrast-enhanced CT abdomen, and CT angiogram findings were unremarkable. Due to repeated episodes of rebleeding leading to haemodynamic instability, an exploratory laparotomy was performed. A retrocaecal appendix was noticed with a macroscopically suspicious-looking dilated tip adhered to the posterior caecal wall. Right hemicolectomy was performed as the lesion was suspicious and to stop bleeding from the site. Ileocolic side-to-side hand-sewn anastomosis was performed using 3/0 polyglactin. Postoperatively, per rectal bleeding was settled. Microscopy revealed appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma with AJCC staging of pT3NoMx. The patient was discharged on postoperative day seven and referred to oncological management. He was offered six cycles of chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

Data collected included age, gender, cause of anoxic event, length of stay in acute and rehabilitation units, discharge destination, and evaluation at admission and discharge using three clinical scales to assess cognitive function, independence and disability. Subjects were identified as good and bad performers on the basis of quantitative analysis of FDG-PET scans with the Cortex ID software. The relation between glucose uptake reduction and neurological outcome was evaluated. Results: good and bad performers presented no statistically significant difference regarding demographical data and in-hospital length of stay.

Despite inconclusive initial diagnostic imaging including a bedside abdominal ultrasound showing minimal ascites, the deterioration of all clinical parameters prompted an exploratory laparotomy.Intra-operative exploration revealed a transected portal vein with significant tissue loss and an avulsed common bile duct. Portal vein reconstruction was done using commercially available bovine pericardium, which was tubularized and grafted proximally and distally with polypropylene 6-0. Intra-operative Doppler ultrasound confirmed the successful restoration of portal venous flow. Additionally, we closed the common bile duct and did a cholecysto-duodenostomy to restore bile flow. Postoperative anticoagulation therapy included unfractionated heparin (10U/kg/hour) for 72 hours followed by aspirin (75mg daily) for six months, frequently monitoring the patency of the graft by Doppler ultrasound.

Primary objectives were to determine safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib was administered at 2 dose levels (DLs) of 5 and 10 mg twice daily, with fludarabine/melphalan conditioning regimen and tacrolimus/sirolimus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. We enrolled 6 and 12 patients at DL1 and DL2, respectively. Median age at transplantation was 65 years (range, 25-73). Per Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System, 4 patients were high and 14 intermediate risk. Peripheral blood stem cells were graft source from matched sibling (n = 5) or unrelated (n = 13) donor. At each DL, 1 patient developed dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs): grade 3 cardiac and gastrointestinal with grade 4 pulmonary DLTs in DL1, and grade 3 kidney injury in DL2. All patients achieved engraftment. Grade 2 to 4 and 3 to 4 acute GVHD cumulative incidence was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6-47) and 11% (95% CI, 3-41), respectively. Cumulative incidence of 1-year chronic GVHD was 42% (95% CI, 24-74).

However, ICI therapy has also been associated with various immune-related adverse events (irAEs), especially for patients with preexisting autoimmune status, which sometimes can be life-threatening. A 68-year-old woman diagnosed with metastatic thymoma was treated with camrelizumab, a new ICI, as her antitumor protocol. Eleven days after the first dose of camrelizumab, the patient was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and poor appetite. Workups on admission indicated dramatically elevated transaminase, troponin I, creatine kinase, and a new-onset conduction abnormality on electrocardiography. After detailed evaluation, ICI-related myocarditis, myositis, and hepatitis were diagnosed, and therapies including intravenous methylprednisolone were administered. Coronary angiography was performed to exclude acute coronary syndrome due to dynamic electrocardiography changes on day 3. She lapsed into a coma with respiratory muscle failure on the next day, which was highly suspected of myasthenic crisis. Mechanical ventilation and higher dose of methylprednisolone plus intravenous immunoglobulin were applied immediately. However, the third atrioventricular block occurred within the same day, and an urgent temporary pacemaker was placed. More seriously, refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurred subsequently, and even multiple antiarrhythmic drugs used in combination failed to alleviate the VT storm. On day 5 of hospitalization, she suffered from ventricular fibrillation and died of cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,A KCNQ1 Mutation Causes a High Penetrance for Familial Atrial Fibrillation,"R231H Causes a High Penetrance for Familial AF Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and its incidence is expected to grow. A genetic predisposition for AF has long been recognized, but its manifestation in these patients likely involves a combination of rare and common genetic variants. Identifying genetic variants that associate with a high penetrance for AF would represent a significant breakthrough for understanding the mechanisms that associate with disease. Method and Results Candidate gene sequencing in 5 unrelated families with familial AF identified the KCNQ1 missense mutation p.Arg231His (R231H). In addition to AF, several of the family members have abnormal QTc intervals, syncope or experienced sudden cardiac arrest or death. KCNQ1 encodes the voltage-gated K+ channel that conducts the slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current in the heart. Functional and computational analyses suggested that R231H increases KCNQ1 current (IKCNQ1) to shorten the atrial action potential (AP) duration. R231H is predicted to minimally affect ventricular excitability, but it prevented the increase in IKCNQ1 following PKA activation. The unique properties of R231H appeared to be caused by a loss in voltage-dependent gating. Conclusions The R231H variant causes a high penetrance for interfamilial early-onset AF. Our study indicates R231H likely shortens atrial refractoriness to promote a substrate for reentry. Additionally, R231H might cause abnormal ventricular repolarization by disrupting PKA activation of IKCNQ1. We conclude genetic variants, which increase IKs during the atrial AP, decrease the atrial AP duration, and/or shorten atrial refractoriness, present a high risk for interfamilial AF.",JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY,2013,"Bartos, DC; Anderson, JB; Bastiaenen, R; Johnson, JN; Gollob, MH; Tester, DJ; Burgess, DE; Homfray, T; Behr, ER; Ackerman, MJ; Guicheney, P; Delisle, BP",10.1111/jce.12068,,WOS:000318242700018,A

We investigated HRT for risk stratification in high-risk patients after MI. HRT from 24-hour Holter monitoring in 481 hospitalized patients after AMI with heart failure and/or diabetes with left ventricular dysfunction before randomization in the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study (EPHESUS). Over a 1-year follow-up, 55 died, 49 of cardiovascular causes. HRT onset (TO) and slope (TS) were calculated using previous and cohort-optimized cutpoints and their, independent contribution to risk of cardiovascular death determined. Models were tested with <5 ventricular premature complexes (PVCs) categorized as normal (n = 452) and with <5 VPCs excluded (n = 342). In EPHESUS, optimal cutpoints were TS :53.0 and TO >= 0.0. The strongest model for predicting cardiovascular mortality used EPHESUS cutpoints excluding subjects with <5 VPCs. On 3-category HRT model multivariate analysis (TS and TO normal, TS or TO abnormal, TS and TO abnormal), both TS and TO abnormal (relative risk 3.64, 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 8.55, p = 0.003) and left ventricular ejection fraction <= 30% (relative risk 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 3.73, p = 0.037) independently predicted cardiovascular death. In conclusion, HRT is an independent predictor of cardiovascular death in a high-risk population after AMI, with a possibly higher optimal cutpoint for HRT slope than previously reported.

Some of them represent devastating injuries with a high morbidity and significant mortality. Related published articles are limited. The increased human interaction within the environment of sharks is the cause of rising incidence of such attacks. This study reported a case of level 4 shark injuries (shark-induced trauma scale) in a 33-year-old male patient, who presented with an extensive injury of the right lower limb with the characteristic features of shark bite. At admission the patient was in a state of shock with profuse bleeding that was controlled by tourniquet. The patient was resuscitated according to the advanced trauma life support. Clinical examination showed hard signs of vascular injury with absent pedal pulse, associated neurological deficits and severance at the knee joint. Prompt vascular intervention after resuscitation was performed to manage the major vascular injuries, together with proper washout and debridement of all the necrotic tissues under strong antibiotic coverage to prevent infection. After that, the patient underwent sequenced plastic, orthopedic, and neurological interventions. Strict follow-up was conducted, which showed that the patient was saved and achieved a functioning limb. This study aims to highlight the management of level 4 shark injuries, which are considered serious and challenging with a high fatality rate and a great risk of amputation due to the associated major vascular injuries.

Automated cardiac arrest detection and alarming using biosensor technology would offer a potential solution to provide early help. We developed and validated an algorithm for automated circulatory arrest detection using wrist -derived photoplethysmography from patients with induced circulatory arrests. Methods In this prospective multicentre study in three university medical centres in the Netherlands, adult patients (aged 18 years or older) in whom short -lasting circulatory arrest was induced as part of routine practice (transcatheter aortic valve implantation, defibrillation testing, or ventricular tachycardia induction) were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria were a known bilateral significant subclavian artery stenosis or medical issues interfering with the wearing of the wristband. After providing informed consent, patients were equipped with a photoplethysmography wristband during the procedure. Invasive arterial blood pressure and electrocardiography were continuously monitored as the reference standard. Development of the photoplethysmography algorithm was based on three consecutive training cohorts. For each cohort, patients were consecutively enrolled. When a total of 50 patients with at least one event of circulatory arrest were enrolled, that cohort was closed. Validation was performed on the fourth set of included patients. The primary outcome was sensitivity for the detection of circulatory arrest. Findings Of 306 patients enrolled between March 14, 2022, and April 21, 2023, 291 patients were included in the data analysis. In the development phase (n=205), the first training set yielded a sensitivity for circulatory arrest detection of 100% (95% CI 94-100) and four false positive alarms; the second training set yielded a sensitivity of 100% (94-100), with six false positive alarms; and the third training set yielded a sensitivity of 100% (94-100), with two false positive alarms. In the validation phase (n=86), the sensitivity for circulatory arrest detection was 98% (92-100) and 11 false positive circulatory arrest alarms. The positive predictive value was 90% (95% CI 82-94). Interpretation The automated detection of induced circulatory arrests using wrist -derived photoplethysmography is feasible with good sensitivity and low false positives. These promising findings warrant further development of this wearable technology to enable automated cardiac arrest detection and alarming in a home setting.

The curbing of HIV is an intricate and continuously evolving domain, marked by numerous challenges, including drug resistance and the absence of a significant cure or vaccine because of its mutating ability and diverse antigens in its envelope, prompting research for functional cures and long-term remission strategies. The endeavor to devise an HIV vaccine capable of eliciting robust and broadly cross-reactive humoral and cellular immune responses is a formidable undertaking, primarily due to the pronounced genetic heterogeneity of HIV-1, the variances observed in virus subtypes (clades) across distinct geographic regions, and the polymorphic nature of human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The viral envelope protein (gp120) selectively interacts with CD4 and chemokine receptors on the surface of target cells. It serves as the key initiator in the intricate viral entry into host cells, rendering it a compelling candidate for vaccine development. This study used bioinformatic tools to design a safe, hypoallergenic, and non-toxic mRNA HIV-1 vaccine by assembling immunogenic B- and T-cell epitopes from the gp120 protein. We identified antigenic, non-toxic, and non-allergic B-cell epitopes (IEPLGIAPTRAKRRVVER) and T-cell epitopes (QQKVHALFY, ITIGPGQVF, WQGVGQAMY, APTRAKRRV, KQQKVHALFYRLDIV, QQKVHALFYRLDIVQ, QKVHALFYRLDIVQI, SLAEEEIIIRSENLT, and IRSENLTNNVKTIIV). For designing the mRNA vaccine against HIV-1 gp120, we assembled the epitopes with 5 ' m7G cap, 5 ' UTR (untranslated region), Kozak sequence, signal peptide (tPA), RpfE (resuscitation-promoting factor E) adjuvant at N-terminal and MITD (MHC class I trafficking domain) adjuvant, stop codon, 3 ' UTR, and 120-nucleotide long poly(A) tail at the C-terminal with immunogenic robustness linkers. The mRNA vaccine is translated into a protein-based vaccine by the host body's ribosomes. Their comprehensive computational findings, including physicochemical, structural, and 3D refinement analyses, substantiated the stability and quality of the translated vaccine. Molecular docking and simulation revealed a strong and stable binding affinity of vaccine immunization with immune cells' pattern recognition receptors (TLR4). Immune simulations demonstrated a potent primary immune response characterized by a gradual increase in immunoglobulins and a corresponding decline in antigen concentration. This bioinformatics-driven study presents a promising HIV-1 mRNA vaccine candidate, underscoring the need for further experimental validation through preclinical and clinical trials.

We investigated the efficacy of MCA in a controlled animal study in which 20 pigs were subjected to intermittent occlusions (5 times) of the left descending coronary artery (5 min. occlusion +10 min. reperfusion). 12 of the 20 animals (60 %) developed 14 events of VF. 64 % of VF developed during reperfusion (p < 0.05). Countershock was attempted up to eight times and was successful in 5 of the 14 events (36%) (primary defibrillation, PD). When conversion was not achieved, total biventricular bypass was instituted. Mean perfusion time between countershock attempts was 24.4 +/- 15.3 min. All animals (n = 9) with cardiac assistance were successfully defibrillated (secondary defibrillation, SD), (p < 0.05). Hemodynamic parameters after SD were not significantly different from those after PD (p > 0.05). Survival rate following PD was 66.6%. Six animals were ultimately weaned from cardiac assistance following SD. Three others died of progressive cardiogenic shock in the six hour follow-up period following SD. These non-survivors had a significantly longer VF time than the survivors (41.7 +/- 10.4 vs. 15.8 +/- 8.0, p < 0.05). Overall survival after SD was the same as that for PD: 66.6% (p > 0.05).

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Contemporary Approach to Neurologic Prognostication of Coma Aft er Cardiac Arrest,"Coma after cardiac arrest (CA) is an important cause of admission to the ICU. Prognosis of post-CA coma has significantly improved over the past decade, particularly because of aggressive postresuscitation care and the use of therapeutic targeted temperature management (TTM). TTM and sedatives used to maintain controlled cooling might delay neurologic reflexes and reduce the accuracy of clinical examination. In the early ICU phase, patients' good recovery may often be indistinguishable (based on neurologic examination alone) from patients who eventually will have a poor prognosis. Prognostication of post-CA coma, therefore, has evolved toward a multimodal approach that combines neurologic examination with EEG and evoked potentials. Blood biomarkers (eg, neuron-specific enolase [NSE] and soluble 100-beta protein) are useful complements for coma prognostication; however, results vary among commercial laboratory assays, and applying one single cutoff level (eg,. 33 mu g/L for NSE) for poor prognostication is not recommended. Neuroimaging, mainly diffusion MRI, is emerging as a promising tool for prognostication, but its precise role needs further study before it can be widely used. This multimodal approach might reduce false-positive rates of poor prognosis, thereby providing optimal prognostication of comatose CA survivors. The aim of this review is to summarize studies and the principal tools presently available for outcome prediction and to describe a practical approach to the multimodal prognostication of coma after CA, with a particular focus on neuromonitoring tools. We also propose an algorithm for the optimal use of such multimodal tools during the early ICU phase of post-CA coma.",CHEST,2014,"Ben-Hamouda, N; Taccone, FS; Rossetti, AO; Oddo, M",10.1378/chest.14-0523,,WOS:000347215500055,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Prognosis After Cardiac Arrest: The Additional Value of DWI and FLAIR to EEG,"Background Despite application of the multimodal European Resuscitation Council and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine algorithm, neurological prognosis of patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest remains uncertain in a large group of patients. In this study, we investigate the additional predictive value of visual and quantitative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to electroencephalography (EEG) for outcome estimation of comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Methods We performed a prospective multicenter cohort study in patients after cardiac arrest submitted in a comatose state to the intensive care unit of two Dutch hospitals. Continuous EEG was recorded during the first 3 days and MRI was performed at 3 +/- 1 days after cardiac arrest. EEG at 24 h and ischemic damage in 21 predefined brain regions on diffusion weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery on a scale from 0 to 4 were related to outcome. Quantitative MRI analyses included mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and percentage of brain volume with ADC < 450 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s, < 550 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s, and < 650 x 10(-6) mm(2)/s. Poor outcome was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 3-5 at 6 months. Results We included 50 patients, of whom 20 (40%) demonstrated poor outcome. Visual EEG assessment correctly identified 3 (15%) with poor outcome and 15 (50%) with good outcome. Visual grading of MRI identified 13 (65%) with poor outcome and 25 (89%) with good outcome. ADC analysis identified 11 (55%) with poor outcome and 3 (11%) with good outcome. EEG and MRI combined could predict poor outcome in 16 (80%) patients at 100% specificity, and good outcome in 24 (80%) at 63% specificity. Ischemic damage was most prominent in the cortical gray matter (75% vs. 7%) and deep gray nuclei (45% vs. 3%) in patients with poor versus good outcome.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,CPAPER,Manufacturing and Design Improvements of an Everting Airway Device Prototype,"Airway management is critical to patient survival in cases of cardiac arrest, drug overdose, and trauma. In 2021, there were nearly 150,000 reported cases of out of hospital cardiac arrest with over 90% leading to death. Current methods of establishing airways in response to cardiac arrest require a high level of expertise, and improper use can result in serious side-effects and death. This poses a need for a safer emergency airway device. Our solution is based on everting vine robots, which are pressurized tubes that passively navigate via tip extension. This paper aims to evaluate whether our Everting Airway Device (EAD) prototype can deploy into the airway at safe pressures with effective sealing. Our device was made with novel material sealing techniques and sealing feature design. The deployed sealing efficacy and minimum pressure required during deployment were measured within a 0.9 '' diameter straight chamber. The ability of the tube to passively navigate the airway was tested by observing deployment patterns into an anatomically accurate, rigid 3D-printed airway derived from the Advanced Joint Airway Management Simulator. The insertion forces of the device into an airway phantom are similar to those of market devices, ranging from 20-39 N. The sealing cuffs can provide adequate sealing at the same pressure values similar to manual insertion market airway devices, which have a recommended sealing pressure of 120 cmH(2)O. The proposed Everting Airway Device design shows promise for future refinement and integration with automated deployment mechanisms and breath delivery systems.","2024 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MEDICAL ROBOTICS, ISMR 2024",2024,"O'Connor, G; Lewis, A; Gong, A; Burke, DM; Hannaford, B",10.1109/ISMR63436.2024.10585972,,WOS:001270850300031,A

Drugs for liver cancer have limited effect, there are not enough donors for liver transplants and many patients are not candidates for surgery to remove the tumor. In many of these cases, hyperthermia can destroy the tumor in situ with minimally invasive methods such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation. In this paper we review the literature evaluating success rates for complete ablation as judged by actual examination of treated tumors that were removed when patients received a liver transplant. While notable successes can be achieved with ablation, the published studies indicate both that complete treatment is not as common as thought and that imaging methods such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans do not completely identify residual cancer.

Chinese aromatic herbs, such as Borneolum (Bingpian), Moschus (Shexiang), and Acori tatarinowii rhizoma (Shichangpu), have long been believed to be ""resuscitation with aromatics"" based on traditional Chinese medicines theory.Patient concerns:A 16-year-old male was admitted to the intensive rehabilitation unit for further treatment due to prolonged coma and frequent seizures following traumatic brain injury.Diagnoses:Western medicine diagnosed the patient as coma, diffuse axonal injury, and epilepsy. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, the syndrome differentiation indicates a Yin-closed disease.Interventions:According to the patient's condition, we use the Chinese aromatic herbs as a complementary therapy.Outcomes:Following a month-long administration, the patient's consciousness and electroencephalogram (EEG) background progressively improved. A 6-month follow-up demonstrated full arousal, though with ambulatory EEG revealing mild to moderate abnormality in the background.Lessons:The addition of Chinese aromatic herbs appears to have a beneficial effect on the patient's consciousness and EEG background.

Skilled anesthesia providers are required for the safe conduct of Cesarean delivery and resuscitation during obstetrical crises. Few anesthesia providers in low-resource settings have access to continuing education. In Rwanda, anesthesia technicians with only three years of post-secondary training must manage complex maternal emergencies in geographically isolated areas. The purpose of this special article is to describe implementation of the SAFE (Safer Anesthesia From Education) Obstetric Anesthesia course in Rwanda, a three-day refresher course designed to improve obstetrical anesthesia knowledge and skills for practitioners in low-resource areas. In addition, we describe how the course facilitated the knowledge-to-action (KTA) cycle whereby a series of steps are followed to promote the uptake of new knowledge into clinical practice. The KTA cycle requires locally relevant teaching interventions and continuation of knowledge post intervention. In Rwanda, this meant carefully considering educational needs, revising curricula to suit the local context, employing active experiential learning during the SAFE Obstetric Anesthesia course, encouraging supportive relationships with peers and mentors, and using participant action plans for change, post-course logbooks, and follow-up interviews with participants six months after the course. During those interviews, participants reported improvements in clinical practice and greater confidence in coordinating team activities.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Down the Wrong Pipe: Tension Pneumoperitoneum from Esophageal Intubation,"background: Tension pneumoperitoneum (TPP) is a rare but life-threatening pathology in which significant accumulation of free air in the peritoneum pressurizes the abdominal cavity, creating conditions similar to abdominal compartment syndrome. Due to compression of intra-abdominal vasculature, TPP results in hemodynamic instability. While it most commonly occurs due to viscus perforation in the setting of recent endoscopy, gastric perforation from resuscitative efforts can also lead to TPP. Case Report: We present a case of a 58-year-old female who was intubated out-of-hospital for unresponsiveness, then subsequently developed abdominal distension, mottled lower extremities, and hemodynamic instability. In the emergency department, the patient self-extubated for a brief time before suffering cardiac arrest. During resuscitative efforts, imaging showed significant abdominal free air concerning for tension pneumoperitoneum. The likely etiology was positive pressure ventilation after esophageal intubation, resulting in gastric perforation and rapid accumulation of air in the peritoneal cavity. Despite emergent abdominal needle decompression and prompt exploratory surgery, the patient expired. Why should an Emergency Physician be aware of this?: TPP is a critical pathology that should be on the differential for any patient with recent unverified intubation presenting with hemodynamic instability and abdominal distension. Abdominal needle decompression is a key intervention for the patient with TPP and should be in the emergency physician's skillset. It is also a reminder that intubated patients require confirmation of correct endotracheal tube placement to prevent negative outcomes. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Biomarkers linked to brain injury, released into circulation from compromised elements of the neurovascular unit, act as significant prognostic indicators in patients suffering from hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) subsequent to the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after pediatric cardiac arrest. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the prognostic utility of brain injury biomarkers in predicting neurological outcomes and survival in patients following cardiac arrest in the pediatric population. Methods: Bibliographic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase) were searched from their inception to November 2024. A random-effect model was used for all analyses. Results: Our meta-analysis demonstrates significant associations between various biomarkers and survival or neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were consist-ently elevated in non-survivors and patients with unfavorable neurological outcomes, with pronounced differences observed on Days 2 and 3 (e.g., Day 3 mean difference: -88.48, 95%CI: -146.77 to-30.19, P = 0.003).

In this study, using a large database we examined the association between myocarditis among COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality and other adverse hospital outcomes. The present study was a retrospective analysis of data collected in the California State Inpatient Database during 2020. All hospitalizations for COVID-19 were included in the analysis and grouped into those with and without myocarditis. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, mechanical ventilation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Propensity score matching, followed by conditional logistic regression, was performed to find the association between myocarditis and outcomes. Among 164,417 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 578 (0.4%) were with myocarditis. After propensity score matching, the rate of in-hospital mortality was significantly higher among COVID-19 hospitalizations with myocarditis (30.0% vs 17.5%, p <0.001). Survival analysis with logrank test showed that 30-day survival rates were significantly lower among those with myocarditis (39.5% vs 46.3%, p <0.001). Conditional logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of cardiac arrest (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16 to 3.14), cardiogenic shock (OR 4.13, 95% CI 2.14 to 7.99), mechanical ventilation (OR 3.30, 95% CI 2.47 to 4.41), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.66) were significantly higher among those with myocarditis.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,New World Health Organization recommendations for care of preterm or low birth weight infants: health policy,"Approximately 11% of infants are born preterm, and complications of prematurity are the most common cause of death in children aged under five years. Almost one million preterm infants die each year across low, high and middle income countries. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) convened a Guideline Development Group (GDG) to examine evidence and formulate recommendations for care of preterm or low birthweight (LBW) infants according to WHO Guideline Review Committee (GRC) criteria. GRADE methods were used to assess the certainty of evidence and the GDG developed judgements using the DECIDE (Developing and Evaluating Communication strategies to support Informed Decisions and practice based on Evidence) framework. Twenty-five recommendations were made; 11 rec-ommendations were new, and 16 were for preventive and promotive care. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) was rec-ommended to start immmediately after birth as routine care for all preterm or LBW newborns (except for critically ill infants who are in shock, unable to breath spontaneously after resuscitation, or require ventilatory support) both in the facility and at home. New recommendations were also made for caffeine to treat apnoea and for extubation; family involvement in routine care for preterm or LBW infants; and for post-discharge home-visit follow-up care. New rec-ommendations were also made to consider use of probiotics, emollient therapy, caffeine for prevention of apnoea, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) immediately after birth (with or without respiratory distress) in infants less than 32 weeks gestational age; and for family support to enable the care of preterm or LBW infants. The recom-mendations confirm the pivotal role of preventive and promotive care for preterm and LBW infants, especially the importance of keeping the baby and mother together, and empowering and supporting families to care for their preterm or LBW infant. WHO is now working to help scale up care for small and sick newborns, including organizational shifts in all 'health system building blocks' such as infrastructure, commodities, workforce and monitoring.

Animal studies have reported that hydrogen gas inhalation helped alleviate cerebral and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In humans, hydrogen inhalation therapy is presently approved as a treatment under Advanced Medical Care B in Japan (jRCTs031180352: limited to adult patients who suffered out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and are in a continuous coma) and its effectiveness is being examined in a clinical trial. The Japanese government has introduced the ""Advanced Medical Care System"" to promote the development of drugs and devices under governmental regulations. Advanced Medical Care B is a system designed for unapproved or off-label drugs or medical technologies used in a clinical trial setting. Hepatectomy is generally performed with repeated hepatic blood-flow occlusion and then reperfusion (ischemia and reperfusion). No report, however, has been made on ROS inhibition by hydrogen inhalation therapy or its effectiveness in post-hepatectomy patients.

In the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction, when early platelet inhibition is highly desirable, the onset of action of oral P2Y(12) receptor inhibitors is, however, delayed, likely due to delayed drug absorption. Crushing the tablets, which are to be used for patient loading with an oral P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor, has been shown to provide earlier platelet inhibition than standard, integral tablets administration. Chewed ticagrelor tablets may also result in a similar effect. Such findings should be interpreted with caution, mainly due to the small number of patients enrolled and the nature (pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic) of the respective studies. Furthermore, in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, who remain comatose, crushing tablets is commonly applied in clinical practice for platelet P2Y(12) receptor inhibition. In this review, we focus on current evidence regarding the role of crushed P2Y(12) receptor inhibitor pills, analyzing clinical scenarios where most of the promise exists along with future expectations from this type of formulation.

We aimed to evaluate a pulsatile normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass-based strategy for thoracic organ recovery of uncontrolled donors after circulatory death and the effects of this strategy on graft function and recipient outcomes. Materials and Methods: In this prospective single-center study, we studied thoracic organs recovered from uncontrolled donors after circulatory death after >= 60 minutes of unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After heparinization and pharmacologic optimization, donors underwent median sternotomy and were connected to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with pulsatile flow. Organ assessment was performed in vivo. Donor, graft, and recipient functional data were recorded, with follow-up results studied through at least 1 year. Results: Forty-two donors were included. All hearts (n = 42) and 40 lungs (from 84 donors) were successfully transplanted. Despite prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, no graft failure or recipient mortality occurred. One year survival for both heart and lung recipients was 100%. Heart grafts showed progressive improvement in functional status, including left ventricular ejection fraction, lactate levels, and New York Heart Association classification; lungs demonstrated sustained gains in gas exchange, pulmonary function tests, and 6-minute walk distance. Mild primary graft dysfunction (grade 1-2) occurred in 10% of lung recipients (all unilateral transplants). Pericardial effusion increased, likely because of trauma before procurement, but resolved without effects on function. Conclusions: Pulsatile normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass enables successful procurement of thoracic organs from uncontrolled donors after circulatory death with excellent outcomes.

To improve the quality of EOLC for children with hematologic malignancies, the aims of this study were (i) to compare intensive EOLC between children with hematologic malignancies and those with solid tumors; and (ii) to describe factors associated with intensive EOLC in children with hematologic malignancies. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 0- to 18-year-old patients with cancer, who died in hospital between April 2012 and March 2016 in Japan using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination per-diem payment system. Indicators of intensive inpatient EOLC were defined as intensive care unit admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation and/or mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation in the last 30 days of life, or intravenous chemotherapy in the last 14 days. We determined factors associated with intensive EOLC using regression models. Data regarding use of blood transfusion were also obtained from the database. Results Among 1199 patients, 433 (36%) had hematological malignancies. Children with hematologic malignancies were significantly more likely than those with solid tumors to have intubation and/or mechanical ventilation (37.9% vs. 23.5%), intensive care unit admission (21.9% vs. 7.2%), CPR (14.5% vs. 7.7%), hemodialysis (13.2% vs. 3.1%) or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (2.5% vs. 0.4%) in their last 30 days, or intravenous chemotherapy (47.8% vs. 18.4%; all P < .01) within their last 14 days of life. Over 90% of children with hematological malignancies received a blood transfusion within the last 7 days of life. For hematological malignancies, age under 5 years was associated with CPR and >= 2 intensive EOLC indicators. Longer hospital stays had decreased odds of >= 2 intensive EOLC indicators.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP1a), initially developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have shown promising results in reducing cardiovascular events. We aimed to investigate the effect of GLP1a on cardiovascular events in patients receiving ICIs. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, propensity score-matched cohort study using the TriNetX database. We identified adults with cancer and T2DM who received ICIs between April 2013 and May 2023. The primary efficacy outcome was incident MACE, defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, need for coronary revascularization, heart failure, ischemic stroke, and cardiac arrest. The secondary efficacy outcomes were the individual components of MACE as well as myocarditis and pericarditis. Safety outcomes included the occurrence of immune-related adverse events, serious adverse events related to GLP1a use, and all-cause mortality. Results: We identified 7651 patients eligible for inclusion, among which 479 received GLP1a and 7172 received non-GLP1a diabetes medications. After matching (469 patients each), baseline characteristics were wellbalanced. Over a median 12-month follow-up, the GLP1a cohort had a significantly lower MACE incidence than the non-GLP1a cohort (9.0 vs. 17.1 events per 100 patient-years) with a 54 % lower risk of MACE (Hazard ratio (HR),0.46 [95 % CI: 0.32-0.67]). There were reductions in myocardial infarction or need for coronary revascularization, heart failure, and all-cause mortality, with no differences in other cardiovascular events. GLP1a use did not increase risk of adverse events, including pancreatitis, biliary disease, bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, and immune-related adverse events.

Machine learning (ML) designed for survival analysis might facilitate personalized risk stratification. We aimed to develop explainable ML models predicting mortality and the first appropriate shock and compare these to standard Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression in ICD recipients. Methods and Results: Forty-five routine clinical variables were collected. Four fine-tuned ML approaches (elastic net Cox regression, random survival forests, survival support vector machine, and XGBoost) were applied and compared with the CPH model on the test set using Harrell's C-index. Of 887 adult patients enrolled, 199 patients died (5.0 per 100 person-years) and 265 first appropriate shocks occurred (12.4 per 100 person-years) during the follow-up. Patients were randomly split into training (75%) and test (25%) sets. Among ML models predicting death, XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy and outperformed the CPH model (C-index: 0.794 vs. 0.760, p < 0.001). For appropriate shock, survival support vector machine showed the highest accuracy, although not statistically different from the CPH model (0.621 vs. 0.611, p = 0.243). The feature contribution of ML models assessed by SHAP values at individual and overall levels was in accordance with established knowledge. Accordingly, a bi-dimensional risk matrix integrating death and shock risk was built. This risk stratification framework further classified patients with different likelihoods of benefiting from ICD implant. Conclusions: Explainable ML models offer a promising tool to identify different risk scenarios in ICD-eligible patients and aid clinical decision making.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Needle in the heart: a rare case of cardiac tamponade caused by a migrated foreign body and mimicking ST segment elevation myocardial infarction,"Background Pericardial tamponade is a serious condition which may eventually lead to severe haemodynamic disturbances and cardiac arrest. It is most often caused by the accumulation of fluid inside the pericardium, as a result of different aetiological factors such as pericarditis, neoplastic diseases, lymphatic dysfunctions, or idiopathic pericardial disease. Pericardial tamponade can develop after cardiac surgical procedures or as a complication of myocardial infarction. Collection of blood inside the pericardial sack can be the result of pericardial or cardiac trauma. It is exceedingly rare for the injury to be caused by a migrating foreign body. Although a typical picture of pericardial tamponade has been previously described, the disorder may clinically resemble an acute myocardial infarction. Case presentation We report the case of a 58-year-old female patient complaining of new onset thoracic pain and shortness of breath. Electrocardiographic examination results were suggestive of an acute inferior myocardial infarction. However, echocardiography revealed significant pericardial tamponade. The cause was found to be a needle which remained inside the pelvis following a previous cesarean delivery, which the patient had undergone 18 years prior. In emergency setting, the needle was removed and the pericardial tamponade was resolved. Due to the prompt and efficient management, the patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and presented no recurrence at the follow-up examinations. Conclusions The migration of foreign bodies through tissues is exceedingly rare. If present, it may cause life-threatening complications. Since the aetiology of pericardial tamponade is vast, a thorough assessment is highly important. Therefore, echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice. We wish to highlight the possibility of migrating foreign bodies as probable cause for pericardial tamponade, as well as the importance of echocardiographic methods in the fast-track evaluation of such critical conditions.",BMC CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS,2021,"Pólos, M; Domokos, D; Sulea, CM; Benke, K; Csikós, G; Nagy, A; Skoda, R; Szabó, A; Merkel, E; Hartyanszky, I; Szabolcs, Z; Merkely, B; Becker, D",10.1186/s12872-021-01950-6,,WOS:000630352500004,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Increased lipoprotein(a) levels independently predict a higher incidence of ventricular arrhythmias: A comprehensive retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and has been linked to ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Beyond its role in cholesterol metabolism, Lp(a) promotes endothelial dysfunction, thrombogenesis, and inflammation, which may contribute to arrhythmogenesis independent of ASCVD. OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the association between Lp(a) levels and the incidence of VA in a large, population-based cohort. METHODS Adults aged >= 18 years with available Lp(a) measurements were identified from the TriNetX research network. Patients were stratified into low (<= 75 nmol/L) and high Lp(a) groups (>75 nmol/L). The primary outcome was the incidence of VA, defined as ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, flutter, or cardiac arrest owing to cardiac causes. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for demographics, ASCVD risk factors, and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were performed after matching. RESULTS Before propensity score matching, 75,655 patients were in the low Lp(a) group and 40,860 in the high Lp(a) group. After matching, each cohort included 39,414 patients. VA occurred in 889 patients in the low and 718 in the high Lp(a) cohort. Mean follow-up was 3.35 years [low Lp(a)] and 1.90 years [high Lp(a)]. The high Lp(a) group had lower VA-free survival (84.30% vs 86.06%, P < .01). High Lp(a) was associated with increased VA risk (hazard ratio 0.855, 95% confidence interval 0.771-0.922, P 5 .045). CONCLUSION Elevated Lp(a) levels are independently associated with a higher incidence of VA, even after adjusting for ASCVD and its downstream consequences.

In this review, we will summarize the historical development, detail the surgical principles, and provide a comprehensive overview of the clinical outcomes of TCRAT. The technique combines cardiopulmonary bypass using peripheral arterial as well as venous cannulation and cardioplegic cardiac arrest using transthoracic aortic cross-clamping with surgical access through a left anterior minithoracotomy. By applying special slinging and rotational maneuvers, both a stable exposition of all coronary territories-in particular those of the right and the circumflex coronary artery-and a quiet, bloodless operating field enable complete anatomical revascularization and complex coronary surgery procedures, including all variations in multiarterial grafting in unselected patients. Data from all published clinical series were integrated, and a weighted analysis of a total of 2282 patients was performed. TCRAT proved to be very effective with regard to complete anatomical revascularization and modern grafting strategies, and it showed excellent perioperative safety in an all-comers population. Both the 30-day mortality and perioperative stroke incidence were distinctly below 1.0%. Data from mid-term follow-up, although rare so far, are promising and compare well to those of the important RCTs. The TCRAT approach eliminates sternal complications completely and accelerates recovery. As an on-pump arrested-heart surgery, TCRAT inherently permits the combination of minimally invasive multivessel CABG with a variety of other cardiac operations, mainly the combination with valve procedures. The integration of robotic and endoscopic assistance represents the next evolutionary step.

Cardiac involvement has previously been identified as the most significant predictor of mortality.Objective To identify and characterise previously untreated patients with EGPA and their cardiac manifestations at disease onset.Methods A retrospective monocentre study was conducted on 103 patients. Upon patient presentation, detailed multidisciplinary physical evaluations and laboratory diagnostics were performed. Cardiac events were defined as EGPA-related abnormalities in ECG, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, invasive coronary angiography or cardiac histopathology.Results Cardiac manifestations were diagnosed in 36 of 103 patients with EGPA (35%). Patients with EGPA with cardiac involvement (EGPA-CI) exhibited typical symptoms of EGPA concomitant with elevated cardiac biomarkers. Pericarditis (77%), cardiomyopathy with cardiac failure (55%) and definite myocarditis (36%) were the most common diagnoses, which in some cases resulted in cardiogenic shock (14%) or cardiac arrest (6%). Vasospastic coronary arteries causing myocardial infarctions were identified as a life-threatening cardiac manifestation in 8% of patients with EGPA-CI. Overall, patients with EGPA-CI presented with significantly higher disease activity and worse prognosis, with elevated median eosinophilic count and C-reactive protein levels.Conclusions Cardiac involvement is a common initial manifestation of EGPA and is associated with elevated systemic disease activity. In addition to pericarditis and myocarditis, coronary vasospasms were identified as a rare and severe manifestation of EGPA that may mimic myocardial infarction.

Prognosis prediction was compared by Cox regression analysis. We established a multivariable model supplemented with RV FD and evaluated its discrimination by Harrell's C-statistic. We compared the category-free, continuous net reclassification improvement (cNRI) and integrated discrimination index (IDI) before and after the addition of FD.ResultsA total of 105 patients were prospectively included from three centers and followed up for a median of 60 (48, 66) months; experienced 36 major cardiac events were recorded. Trabecular FD displayed a strong unadjusted association with major cardiac events (p<0.05). In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, RV maximal apical FD maintained an independent association with major cardiac events (hazard ratio, 1.31 (1.11-1.55), p<0.002). The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test displayed good fit (X-2=0.68, p=0.99).

Surgical repair involved using lateral polypropylene 5-O sutures for the carotid sheath, end-to-end oesophageal repair with absorbable 3 - 0 polygalactin sutures. As tracheal repair was not possible posterior wall was approximated with 3 - 0 polypropylene and size 7 tracheostomy tube was inserted and secured.

We report the case of an elderly woman who presented to the emergency room suffering from an anaphylactic shock caused by a bee sting and who was diagnosed with an anterolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with moderately impaired left ventricular ejection. The patient was successfully managed with the administration of intravenous antihistaminic drugs and steroids, intravenous fluid volume resuscitation, and intramuscular epinephrine. The patient then underwent emergency coronary angiography, which showed a thrombotic subtotal occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and occlusion of the very distal apical LAD due to a spontaneous embolism. This was treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention with thrombus aspiration and drug-eluting stent implantation in the proximal LAD, achieving a good angiographic result. Nevertheless, on day 3, the patient developed a left ventricular apical thrombosis, as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance, requiring oral anticoagulation with rivaroxaban, de-escalation of dual antiplatelet therapy from ticagrelor to clopidogrel with acetylsalicylic acid, and finally a switch to dual antithrombotic therapy. The 3-month follow-up was uneventful.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Case report: Dieulafoy's lesion as a rare cause of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage,"Introduction and importance: Dieulafoy's lesion is a rare but serious cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, typically affecting older adults. It involves an aberrant arteriole eroding the gastric mucosa, resulting in severe, recurrent bleeding that poses diagnostic and management challenges. We present a case report of massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage with hemodynamic instability associated with a Dieulafoy's lesion. Case presentation: A 55-year-old male with no significant medical history presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, showing signs of hematemesis and melena. He was hemodynamically unstable upon admission, with a hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL. After resuscitation and stabilization, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a 5 mm Dieulafoy lesion in the fundus, treated successfully with hemostatic clips. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the fourth day, with normal follow-up at one year and no complications. Clinical discussion: Dieulafoy's lesion, a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding, is found in 1-2 % of cases, primarily in males over 60 years old. First described by Dieulafoy, it results from an aberrant arteriole erosion, commonly in the upper stomach. Diagnosis is challenging during active bleeding and often requires multiple endoscopies. Mechanical hemostasis methods during endoscopy are effective, with recurrence rates of 8-10 %. Surgical intervention is reserved for severe, uncontrolled cases. Conclusion: Dieulafoy's lesion, though rare, requires prompt diagnosis and effective endoscopic treatment to manage severe bleeding. Combining hemostatic techniques or surgical options may be necessary to address persistent cases and improve patient outcomes.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS,2025,"Touati, MD; Bouzid, A; Hajji, R; Ben Othmane, MR; Belhadj, A; Chebbi, F",10.1016/j.ijscr.2024.110810,,WOS:001421862600001,A

Primary resuscitation was offered to all children based on the advanced trauma and life support (ATLS) protocol. A special algorithm for decision-making was followed. It incorporated the FAST, baseline ultrasound (US), CEUS, and CECT. Patients were treated according to the imaging findings and hemodynamic stability.ResultsAll 246 children who sustained a blunt abdominal were studied. Patients' age was 10.5 +/- 2.1. Road traffic accidents were the most common cause of trauma; 155 patients (63%). CECT showed the extent of injury in 153 patients' spleen (62%) and 78 patients' liver (32%), while the remaining 15 (6%) patients had both injuries. CEUS detected 142 (57.7%) spleen injury, and 67 (27.2%) liver injury.ConclusionsCEUS may be a useful diagnostic tool among hemodynamically stable children who sustained low-to-moderate energy isolated blunt abdominal trauma.

The difference in the median delay to treatment between the group treated in the hospital and those treated earlier was 2 1/4 h. After 30 months, mortality in the early group was less than half that in the later group, so that every hour of delay beyond 2 h resulted in almost 7 additional deaths per 100 patients treated. This is a greater percentage loss of life than would have resulted from a similar delay in the provision of resuscitation for the prehospital cardiac arrest. Multivariate analysis showed that age, treatment delay, and time of presentation were significant risk factors, with patients presenting at 1 h having more than twice the mortality of those presenting at 4 h; the sicker the patient, the earlier the presentation. By 5 years, prehospital administration of anistreplase, by saving 2 h, resulted in an additional 57% of a year's survival per patient. This compares favorably with the projected 14% of a year survival per patient reported with TPA versus streptokinase in GUSTO.

Skilled anesthesia providers are required for the safe conduct of Cesarean delivery and resuscitation during obstetrical crises. Few anesthesia providers in low-resource settings have access to continuing education. In Rwanda, anesthesia technicians with only three years of post-secondary training must manage complex maternal emergencies in geographically isolated areas. The purpose of this special article is to describe implementation of the SAFE (Safer Anesthesia From Education) Obstetric Anesthesia course in Rwanda, a three-day refresher course designed to improve obstetrical anesthesia knowledge and skills for practitioners in low-resource areas. In addition, we describe how the course facilitated the knowledge-to-action (KTA) cycle whereby a series of steps are followed to promote the uptake of new knowledge into clinical practice. The KTA cycle requires locally relevant teaching interventions and continuation of knowledge post intervention. In Rwanda, this meant carefully considering educational needs, revising curricula to suit the local context, employing active experiential learning during the SAFE Obstetric Anesthesia course, encouraging supportive relationships with peers and mentors, and using participant action plans for change, post-course logbooks, and follow-up interviews with participants six months after the course. During those interviews, participants reported improvements in clinical practice and greater confidence in coordinating team activities.

Both phenomenological and qualitative empirical studies have shown that physical illnesses, such as cancer or chronic pain, can be accompanied by a change in experienced temporality. Likewise, the sudden onset of severe heart disease in early and middle age represents a biographical break for the patient and can lead to numerous changes in the experience of time. In our qualitative study, a purposive sample of sixteen patients aged 30-59 years was included. Of these, four patients had sudden cardiac arrest, seven had myocardial infarction, and five had other severe cardiac diseases. Phenomenological semi-structured interviews were conducted and analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Patients reported that their temporality changed after serious heart disease. The experience of the participants can be summarized in five themes: ""Heart disease as a biographical turning point,"" ""The clock can stop any moment,"" ""Feeling prematurely aged by heart disease,"" ""Other people's time is not my time,"" and ""Just living in the moment.""

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Learning by teaching basic life support: a non-randomized controlled trial with medical students,"BackgroundCardiopulmonary resuscitation is usually taught in universities through theoretical lectures and simulations on mannequins with low retention of knowledge and skills. New teaching methodologies have been used to improve the learning, placing the student at the center of the process. Likewise, the outside community knows next to nothing about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Patients who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest will die if the effective maneuvers are not promptly done. Learning by teaching could be a way to answer both requirements. It was therefore decided to evaluate whether the medical students' cardiopulmonary resuscitation performance would improve when they teach other people, and if those people could learn with them effectively.MethodsA non-randomized controlled trial was designed to assess whether teaching Basic Life Support would increase students' learning. Socially engaged, seeking to disseminate knowledge, 92 medical students were trained in Basic Life Support and who subsequently trained 240 community health professionals. The students performed theoretical and practical pre- and post-tests whereas the health professionals performed theoretical pre- and post-tests and one practical test. In order to assess the impact of teaching on students' learning, they were divided into two groups: a case group, with 53 students, reassessed after teaching health professionals, and a control group, with 39 students, reassessed before teaching.ResultsThe practical students' performance of the case group went from 13.32.1 to 15.3 +/- 1.2 (maximum=17, p<0.001) and theoretical from 10.1 +/- 3.0 to 16.4 +/- 1.7 (maximum=20, p<0.001) while the performance of the control group went from 14.4 +/- 1.6 to 14.4 +/- 1.4 (p=0.877) and from 11.2 +/- 2.6 to 15.0 +/- 2.3 (p<0.001), respectively.

Assessment of quality of life and frailty is necessary to determine the level of care required for elderly patients. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a validated tool for assessing frailty and predicting mortality, but its role in ICU triage remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the CFS of patients admitted to the ICU with those admitted to the general inpatient unit (GIU) after receiving initial intensive care. This was a retrospective, single-center study including patients aged >= 75 years admitted to the ED RR from November 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. The primary outcome was the comparison of CFS between ICU and GIU admissions after RR management. Secondary outcomes included predictive performance of CFS for ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Of the 392 patients enrolled, 170 (43%) were admitted to the ICU and 222 (57%) to the GIU. The median CFS was 3 (2-4) in ICU-admitted patients and 4 (3-5) in GIU-admitted patients (p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality rate was 30/170 (18%) in the ICU-admitted group and 35/222 (16%) in the GIU-admitted group (p = 0.72). CFS predictive value for ICU admission had an area under the curve of 0.68 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.63-0.73) and for in-hospital mortality of 0.62 (95%CI: 0.55-0.69). In elderly patients admitted to the RR, CFS values differed between those admitted to ICU and those admitted to GIU.

Deep neural networks hold promise to achieve similar or even better performance, being more objective and consistent. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Medical ICU of five teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients: Eight-hundred ninety-five consecutive comatose patients after cardiac arrest. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Continuous electroencephalogram was recorded during the first 3 days after cardiac arrest. Functional outcome at 6 months was classified as good (Cerebral Performance Category 1-2) or poor (Cerebral Performance Category 3-5). We trained a convolutional neural network, with a VGG architecture (introduced by the Oxford Visual Geometry Group), to predict neurologic outcome at 12 and 24 hours after cardiac arrest using electroencephalogram epochs and outcome labels as inputs. Output of the network was the probability of good outcome. Data from two hospitals were used for training and internal validation (n = 661). Eighty percent of these data was used for training and cross-validation, the remaining 20% for independent internal validation. Data from the other three hospitals were used for external validation (n = 234). Prediction of poor outcome was most accurate at 12 hours, with a sensitivity in the external validation set of 58% (95% CI, 51-65%) at false positive rate of 0% (CI, 0-7%). Good outcome could be predicted at 12 hours with a sensitivity of 48% (CI, 45-51%) at a false positive rate of 5% (CI, 0-15%) in the external validation set. Conclusions: Deep learning of electroencephalogram signals outperforms any previously reported outcome predictor of coma after cardiac arrest, including visual electroencephalogram assessment by trained electroencephalogram experts.

Purpose: There is no reporting system for marathon-associated sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death in the United States. The purpose of this study was to estimate and characterize the risk of marathon-related SCA to assist with emergency planning. Methods: A retrospective Web-based survey was sent out to all US marathon medical directors (n = 400) to gather details of SCA including demographics, resuscitation efforts, mortality, and autopsy results, if available. Results: A total of 88 surveys (22%) were returned from marathons run from 1976 to 2009 for a total of 1,710,052 participants. Risks of SCA and sudden cardiac death were 1 in 57,002 and 1 in 171,005, respectively. Men made up the vast majority of SCA victims (93%, mean age = 49.7 yr, range = 19-82 yr).

We aimed therefore at evaluating a possible association between PaO2, circulatory failure and death during ECPR. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 44 consecutive cardiac arrest (CA) patients treated with ECPR to determine the association between the mean PaO2 over the first 24 h, arterial blood pressure, vasopressor and intravenous fluid therapies, mortality, and cause of deaths. Results Eleven patients (25%) survived to hospital discharge. The main causes of death were refractory circulatory shock (46%) and neurological damage (24%). Compared to survivors, non survivors had significantly higher mean 24 h PaO2 (306 +/- 121 mmHg vs 164 +/- 53 mmHg, p < 0.001), lower mean blood pressure and higher requirements in vasopressors and fluids, but displayed similar pulse pressure during the first 24 h (an index of native cardiac recovery). The mean 24 h PaO2 was significantly and positively correlated with the severity of hypotension and the intensity of vasoactive therapies. Patients dying from circulatory failure died after a median of 17 h, compared to a median of 58 h for patients dying from a neurological cause. Patients dying from neurological cause had better preserved blood pressure and lower vasopressor requirements.

In this review, we aim to describe the main specificities of the diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia through consideration of the physiological changes that occur in hypothermic patients. Hypothermia can occur due to unfavorable environmental conditions as well as internal causes, such as pathological states that result in reduced heat production, increased heat loss or ineffectiveness of the thermal regulation system. The consequences of hypothermia affect several systems in the body-the cardiovascular system, the central and peripheral nervous systems, the respiratory system, the endocrine system and the gastrointestinal system-but also kidney function, electrolyte balance and coagulation. Once hypothermia is recognized, prompt treatment, focused on restoring body temperature and supporting vital functions, is fundamental in order to avert preventable death. It is important to also denote the fact that CPR has specificities related to the unique profile of hypothermic patients.",JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE,2023,"Savioli, G; Ceresa, IF; Piccini, GB; Gri, N; Nardone, A; La Russa, R; Saviano, A; Piccioni, A; Ricevuti, G; Esposito, C",10.3390/jpm13121690,,WOS:001131178500001,A

However, the utility and accuracy of prehospital BGA are subjects of ongoing debate. Objectives: We aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the current literature on prehospital BGA, including its indications, methods, and feasibility. Methods: We performed a scoping review of prehospital BGA. A thorough search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted to identify relevant studies focusing on prehospital BGA in adult patients. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Prehospital BGA was most frequently performed in patients in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, followed by traumatic and nontraumatic cases. The parameters most commonly analyzed were pH, pCO2, 2 , pO2, 2 , and lactate. Various sampling methods, including arterial, venous, and intraosseous, were reported for prehospital BGA. While prehospital BGA shows promise in facilitating early identification of critical patients and guiding resuscitation efforts, logistical challenges are to be considered. The handling of preclinical BGA is described as feasible and useful in most of the included studies. Conclusion: Prehospital BGA holds significant potential for enhancing patient care in the prehospital setting, though technical challenges need to be considered. However, further research is required to establish optimal indications and demonstrate the benefits for prehospital BGA in specific clinical contexts. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

In response to the problem of the selection of locations for medical drone vertiports (for take-off and landing) that are equipped with automatic external defibrillation facilities, a survival function was introduced to establish a model for site selection, with the primary optimization objective of maximizing the average survival rate of patients and taking the operating costs of a system into account. At the same time, considering the constraints of drone phase operation time, energy consumption, coverage range, etc., a medical drone vertiport site selection model was established for emergency cardiac arrest needs. An improved immune algorithm was applied to the model's calculations and the analysis of the results, using the Jinnan District in Tianjin as an example. The results show that the proposed model and algorithm are feasible and applicable. The Jinnan District in the city of Tianjin requires a total of 24 medical drone vertiports in order to achieve full coverage of an area under the ""golden 4-minute"" rescue time. When the average survival rate of patients is 0.9, the operation results are deemed optimal, and the average survival rate of patients is 64.06%. Compared to ground ambulances currently used in hospitals, the implementation of medical drones could significantly shorten response time, improve the average survival rate of patients by 41.96%, and effectively improve the existing low survival rate and the accessibility of medical services.

Findings From a Scoping Review,"Background: Rapid Response Systems (RRS) aim to implement systematic processes for the early detection and management of emergencies in hospitals. Exploring the current characteristics and organisation of RRS in Europe and evaluating clinical outcomes may help identify areas for improvement. Aim: To provide an overview of the studies conducted in Europe, summarising the characteristics of RRS, their organisational structure and the clinical outcomes documented to date. Study Design: A scoping review was conducted according to the framework of Levac and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The review protocol was registered with Open Science Framework (OSF); CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PubMed and Scopus were then searched. Quantitative primary studies about RRS conducted in Europe and published in English were included. Results: Twenty-three studies were found, of which 18 (78.3%) were published in the last 10 years. Eleven (47.8%) aimed to describe the function and activities of RRS, while 12 (52.2%) analysed patient outcomes and two (8.7%) the effectiveness, feasibility and costs of RRS. Heterogeneous organisational patterns of RRS emerged, including terminologies (Medical Emergency Team [MET], Rapid Response Team [RRT], Cardiac Arrest Team [CAT], Critical Care Outreach [CCO]), team composition, availability, activation systems and activities. Conclusions: The number of RRS studies is increasing, especially to compare their organisational structure under heterogeneous terminologies. Future research should investigate the outcome variations between different RRS structures. In addition, guidelines that standardise the minimum data set in the field of RRS by also introducing registries could increase consistency between European practices and studies.

Balanced transfusion with red blood cells, plasma, and platelets (component therapy, CT) has been shown to reduce mortality, and is the standard of care. Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood (LTOWB) is an attractive alternative to CT, but existing evidence comprises observational studies, and a small single center pilot randomized controlled trial, which evaluated a type of whole blood that is no longer in use. The aim of the ""Trauma Resuscitation with Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood Or Products"" (TROOP) trial is to compare the effectiveness and safety of LTOWB and CT in critically injured patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.MethodsThis is a pragmatic, multicenter, Bayesian, sequential non-inferiority/superiority, randomized clinical trial, performed within 15 level I trauma centers in the United States. We aim to randomize 1,100 injured patients to resuscitation with either CT or LTOWB. The primary outcome is 6-h mortality. Secondary outcomes include 24-h and 30-day or hospital mortality (whichever is earlier); prespecified complications; adjudicated cause of death; time to death; length of stay (ICU and hospital); and hospital-, ventilator- and ICU-free days; the incidence of major surgical procedures; time to hemostasis in those undergoing procedures with a hemostatic component; number and type of blood products used until hemostasis is achieved (and randomized products are discontinued), as well as after hemostasis has been achieved, to 24 h post-admission; discharge destination and functional status and quality of life at hospital discharge or 30 days, as measured by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and EuroQol (EQ-5D) quality of life measurement.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.DiscussionThis large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume transfusion.Trial registrationNational Clinical Trial Identified Number: NCT05638581.Clinical trial registry: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05638581First submitted 2022-11-08.",TRIALS,2025,"Jansen, JO; Pedroza, C; Novelo, LL; Hao, TY; Dewildt, GR; Coton, CF; Mansoor, K; Stephens, SW; Marques, MB; Stubbs, JR; Richter, JR; Wang, HE; Holcomb, JB; Desantis, SM",10.1186/s13063-025-08971-y,,WOS:001541864500002,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Rinaldo's role in the medical emergency team and rapid response systems,"In the 1990s, there was emerging evidence that patients admitted to hospitals frequently suffered inhospital cardiac arrest, unplanned admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and potentially preventable in-hospital death. These events were often preceded by objective signs of instability and suboptimal recognition and response by hospital ward staff. Rinaldo Bellomo collaborated with key Australian and international leaders to develop a novel and paradigm-shifting model of care referred to as the medical emergency team (MET). This team is comprised of senior staff members who are experts in the assessment and management of acutely deteriorating patients. In Australia and New Zealand, staff members from the ICU are frequently the team leaders for the MET. The team is called when a patient develops objective signs of clinical deterioration, prior to the onset of cardiac arrest. Rinaldo led, mentored, and supervised a systematic and structured research program that evaluated the nature and effectiveness of the MET at Austin Health and throughout Australia. This commenced with single-centre before-and-after studies and progressed to the first Australian ICU cluster-randomised controlled trial. His unique skillset was pivotal in the emergence and promulgation of this model of care worldwide resulting in countless lives saved from preventable morbidity and mortality.

Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of intraoperative increase in systemic oxygen delivery on postoperative outcomes and quality of life in elderly patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. This randomised, blinded, parallel-arm, pragmatic clinical trial included elderly patients of >60 years of age undergoing major abdominal surgery. The patients in the intervention arm received noradrenaline or increased fractional inspiration of oxygen to augment central venous oxygen saturation >= 75%. The primary outcome measure was composite of in-hospital mortality and major organ complications. The secondary outcome measure included comparison of quality of life. A total of 160 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 146 were randomised in the study groups. The mean arterial and central venous oxygen saturation increased and were significantly higher in the intervention arm. The composite primary outcome occurred in 49.31% in the intervention arm and 57.53% in the usual care arm (relative risk; 95% confidence interval: 0.85; 0.63-1.16; absolute risk reduction; 8.22%; p = 0.32). Furthermore, quality of life at the end of three months was similar (0.658 +/- 0.19 versus 0.647 +/- 0.19; p = 0.771).

REBOA is an emergency procedure for temporary intra-aortic balloon occlusion being increasingly reported and published since its inauguration in 1954. The interdisciplinary management of hemorrhage and technical notes for a successful REBOA procedure will be presented. Case presentationA 53-year-old female patient was admitted to the neurosurgery clinic suffering from left-sided L5 radiculopathy. During surgery, the anterior longitudinal ligament was perforated and an arterial vessel was lacerated. The patient became hemodynamically unstable demanding prompt supine repositioning and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). REBOA enabled cardiovascular stabilization after 90 min of CPR and laparotomy with vascular reconstruction and contributed to the survival of the patient without major clinical deficits. The patient was discharged from the ICU after 7 days. Clinical discussionResuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta is an emergency procedure to control life-threatening hemorrhage. REBOA should be available on-scene and applied by well-trained vascular surgery personnel to control vascular complications or extend to emergency laparotomy and thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping in case of in-hospital non-controllable hemorrhages. In case of ongoing CPR, we recommend surgical groin incision, open puncture of the pulseless common femoral artery, and aortic balloon inflation in REBOA zone I. Hereby, fast access and CPR optimization for heart and brain perfusion are maintained.

A polytherapeutic drug that can be administered immediately after reperfusion may increase protection to the brain by simultaneously targeting multiple deleterious cascades. This study evaluated efficacy of the combination of three clinically approved drugs: lamotrigine, minocycline, and lovastatin, using two mouse models: global and focal cerebral ischemia induced by transient occlusion of the common carotid arteries or the middle cerebral artery, respectively. In vitro, the combination drug, but not single drug, protected neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death. The combination drug simultaneously targeted cell apoptosis and DNA damage induced by ischemia. Besides acting on neurons, the combination drug suppressed inflammatory processes in microglia and brain endothelial cells induced by ischemia. In a transient global ischemia model, the combination drug, but not single drug, suppressed microglial activation and inflammatory cytokine production, and reduced neuronal damage. In a transient focal ischemia model, the combination drug, but not single drug, attenuated brain infarction, suppressed infiltration of peripheral neutrophils, and reduced neurological deficits following ischemic stroke. In summary, the combination drug confers a broad-spectrum protection against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and could be a promising approach for early neuroprotection after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or ischemic stroke.",TRANSLATIONAL STROKE RESEARCH,2017,"Yu, IC; Kuo, PC; Yen, JH; Paraiso, HC; Curfman, ET; Hong-Goka, BC; Sweazey, RD; Chang, FL",10.1007/s12975-017-0543-5,,WOS:000413236900006,A

We aimed to assess when the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) can improve CPC outcome description, especially in CPC 3. We further aimed to correlate neuron specific enolase (NSE) with both functional measures to explore their relationship with neuronal damage. Methods: Peak NSE within the first 48 hours, and CPC and mRS at 3 months were prospectively collected for 665 consecutive comatose adults following CA treated between April 2016 and April 2023. For each CPC category, mRS was described. We considered good outcome as mRS 1-3, in line with existing recommendations. CPC and mRS were correlated to peak serum NSE using non-parametric assessments. Results: CPC 1, 2, 4 and 5 correlated almost perfectly with mRS in terms of good and poor outcomes. However, CPC 3 was heterogeneously associated to the dichotomized mRS (53.1% had good outcome (mRS 0-3), 46.9% poor outcome (mRS 4-6)). NSE was strongly correlated with CPC (Spearman's rho 0.616, P < 0.001) and mRS (Spearman's rho 0.613, P < 0.001). Conclusion: CPC and mRS correlate similarly with neuronal damage. Whilst CPC 1-2 and CPC 4-5 are strongly associated with mRS 0-3 and, respectively, with mRS 5-6, CPC 3 is heterogenous: both good and poor mRS scores are found within this category.

Endoscopically, it is characterized by the circumferential black discoloration of the esophagus. We present the case of a 55-year-old male with a history of multiple comorbidities, including uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoker, peripheral arterial disease, and a right above-ankle amputation, who presented with active hematemesis and melena with hemodynamic instability. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse, circumferential necrotizing esophagitis with black discoloration and ulcerations affecting the middle and distal thirds of the esophagus. The severity increased from the proximal to the distal esophagus, abruptly ending at the gastroesophageal junction. These endoscopic findings, combined with the patient's medical history, were consistent with a diagnosis of acute esophageal necrosis. The patient was admitted to the ward and managed conservatively with intravenous fluid resuscitation, IV proton pump inhibitor twice daily, sucralfate 1 gram every six hours, strict glycemic control using insulin, total parenteral nutrition, empirical IV antibiotics, and placed on nil-peroral (NPO) for three days. A follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy conducted twenty-two days post-admission showed complete healing of the esophageal mucosa without stricture formation. Despite its rarity, prompt diagnosis and management of acute esophageal necrosis are crucial due to its association with high morbidity and mortality, as well as the need to minimize complications such as perforations and strictures, particularly in patients with comorbidities.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The aftermath of surviving a sudden cardiac arrest for young exercisers-a qualitative study in Norway,"BackgroundWhen surviving a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), physical, cognitive, and emotional effects of surviving may be present for months or years. The survivors' family and colleagues are also highly affected by the incident. There is little knowledge about experiences of surviving SCA in individuals who prior to the incident were young and reported to exercise regularly. Consequently, the aim of this study was to explore the aftermath of surviving a SCA in young, regular exercisers. MethodsThe study had a qualitative design, conducting in-depth individual interviews with SCA survivors < 50 years of age reporting to exercise & GE; 5 h/week and/or who suffered SCA during or less than 60 min after exercise. The data were analysed using systematic text condensation in-line with recommendations from Malterud. Results18 of 31 eligible participants were included in the study. Through analysis we identified 'Establishing a new everyday life' as superordinate category, with subordinate categories a) being part of my surroundings, b) expecting normality but facing a new reality and c) lucky to be alive! ConclusionThis study adds knowledge about young and regular exercisers' experiences after surviving a SCA. The obligations of everyday life in young survivors of SCA often imply a high work load and complex tasks, e.g. due to being in the beginning of their career or even still studying. Healthcare personnel, as well as the society, need to acknowledge that although lucky to be alive and apparently well-functioning, young survivors of SCA may have persistent challenges that cause frustration and reduced quality of life.",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2022,"Hardeland, C; Leonardsen, ACL; Isern, CB; Berge, HM",10.1186/s12913-022-08674-z,,WOS:000893074900001,A

The present umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) of randomized controlled trials aimed to synthesize the available evidence and highlight promising avenues for intervention. Overall, the literature provides mixed and limited evidence in support of prenatal interventions. Thirty SRMAs were included. Of the 23 SRMAs that reported on prenatal depression interventions, 16 found a significant effect (average standard mean difference =-0.45, SD = 0.25). Similarly, 13 of the 20 SRMAs that reported on anxiety outcomes documented significant reductions (average standard mean difference =-0.76, SD = 0.95 or-0.53/0.53 excluding one outlier). Only 4 SRMAs reported child outcomes, and only 2 (of 10) analyses showed significant effects of prenatal interventions (massage and telephone support on neonatal resuscitation [relative risk = 0.43] and neonatal intensive care unit admissions [relative risk = 0.91]). Notably missing, perhaps due to our strict inclusion criteria (inclusion of randomized controlled trials only), were interventions focusing on key facets of prenatal health (e.g., whole diet, sleep). Structural interventions (housing, access to health care, economic security) were not included, although initial success has been documented in non-SRMAs.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Tranexamic acid induced seizure during spine surgery: A case report,"Introduction and importance: The management of perioperative blood loss is a significant concern in spine surgery, directly affecting patient recovery and outcomes. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely used to minimize intraoperative bleeding and reduce the need for transfusions. Despite its benefits, TXA can pose risks, including rare but severe complications such as seizures. Understanding the balance between its hemostatic advantages and potential adverse effects is critical. This case discusses a 66-year-old female who experienced a generalized tonicclonic seizure after TXA administration during spine surgery. Presentation of case: A 66-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, depression, anxiety, and multiple spine surgeries presented with severe back and hip pain after a fall. She was found to have a fracture through her posterior fusion mass at L1-2. She underwent T10-L5 reinstrumentation, fusion, and L1-L2 laminectomy. She received a standard bolus of TXA and after being flipped supine developed a generalized tonicclonic seizure which was controlled with propofol and versed. She experienced a subsequent seizure and PEA while in the CT suite, followed by successful resuscitation. She was discharged uneventfully to rehab with neurology follow up. Clinical discussion: TXA is effective in reducing surgical blood loss but can cause seizures by crossing the cerebrovascular barrier and antagonizing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). The incidence of TXA-induced seizures is rare, particularly in orthopedic surgery. Conclusion: Careful preoperative assessment and vigilant perioperative monitoring are essential when utilizing TXA in spine surgery.

However, the potential risk of incorrect ABO typing following LTOWB administration, possibly leading to mis-transfusion, remains insufficiently explored. This case series aims to highlight the potential risk of ABO mistyping associated with LTOWB transfusions in trauma settings.Study Design and MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed three cases involving trauma patients who received LTOWB transfusions at a high-volume urban Level 1 Trauma Center. ABO and RhD typing were performed using automated column agglutination technology (Ortho ID-MTS (TM)), and discordant typing results prompted further investigations to confirm patients' true ABO type and identify mis-transfusions.ResultsAll three patients initially received LTOWB due to traumatic hemorrhage. Initial ABO typing after LTOWB administration incorrectly identified the patients as group O. Follow-up investigations later confirmed their true blood types as group A. Two cases resulted in subsequent inadvertent transfusions of ABO-incompatible plasma. Although no severe adverse clinical outcomes occurred, these events were reported to regulatory bodies as biologic product deviations.DiscussionOur findings highlight a rare but clinically significant risk of ABO typing errors following LTOWB transfusion, primarily due to contamination of patient samples with donor blood. Such errors carry the potential for acute hemolytic reactions, underscoring the critical need for strict adherence to sampling protocols. Whenever possible, ABO typing should be performed prior to LTOWB administration, and samples should be drawn from a site contralateral to the transfusion.",TRANSFUSION,2025,"Brown, M; Sharma, D; Atchison, K; Dennis, BM; Hall, E; Mueller, A; Schaeffer, C; Schucht, JE; Streams, JR; Tahiri, T; Booth, GS; Jacobs, JW",10.1111/trf.18268,,WOS:001472947900001,A

FGs due to rectal cancer occur rarely and there is a lack of clinical reference. In the present study, a severe FG due to rectal cancer perforation was described and the features of this rare disease were summarized with a literature review. A 57-year-old man was admitted because of rectal cancer-induced FG. The patient was misdiagnosed with extensive perianal abscess until the intraoperative biopsy confirmed that rectal cancer was the culprit. Incision, debridement and drainage were carried out to reduce infectious burdens. After that, the patient was transferred to Peking University People's Hospital for the subsequent therapy. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was used at the initial stage. Diversional transverse loop colostomy was performed to control infection and resume oral feeding. After four rounds of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy, radical resection and wound closure were accomplished. The scrotal defect was repaired by a skin flap. Pathological results indicated a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with perforation. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 15 without any post-operative complications. No signs of recurrence were observed during a 22-month follow-up. In the setting of rectal cancer-induced FGs, the liquid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and prompt debridement are the cornerstones of the initial management.

However, it is sometimes difficult to diagnose and treat patients with various arrhythmias. Case summary A 49-year-old woman who underwent ablation of typical atrial flutter (AFL) at 31 years of age visited the emergency room due to a cardiopulmonary arrest. Her 12-lead electrocardiogram during sinus rhythm after resuscitation exhibited first-degree atrioventricular block with right bundle branch block and right axis deviation. No structural heart disease was evident on standard imaging screening. An implantation of a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was indicated. After the ICD implantation, she then experienced multiple ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of triggered ventricular premature contractions (VPCs) was performed but failed because the clinical VPCs could not be induced during the session. Although no pathogenic variants associated with Brugada syndrome or long-QT syndrome were found, a rare HCN4 variant, c.1209+2_1209+3insGAGT (rs786205418), was identified in a gene panel analysis. Because high-frequency clinical pacing was effective for suppressing the VF, the single-chamber ICD was upgraded to a dual-chamber ICD. Thereafter, high-rate pacing successfully prevented any further ventricular arrhythmias during the follow up. Discussion A clinical course with prominent wide QRS complexes and AFL in one's early 30s followed by sudden onset of a VF storm about 20 years later is extremely rare.

Autonomic imbalance, sustained by an abnormal afferent signalling, is a key component of I/R injury. Accordingly, there is a strong rationale for neuromodulation strategies, aimed at reducing sympathetic activity and/or increasing vagal tone, in this setting. In this review we focus on cervical vagal nerve stimulation (cVNS) and on transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS); the latest has the potential to overcome several of the issues of invasive cVNS, including the possibility of being used in an acute setting, while retaining its beneficial effects. First, we discuss the pathophysiology of I/R injury, that is mostly a consequence of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Second, we describe the functional anatomy of the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system and the most relevant principles of bioelectronic medicine applied to electrical vagal modulation, with a particular focus on taVNS. Then, we provide a detailed and comprehensive summary of the most relevant pre-clinical studies of invasive and non-invasive VNS that support its strong cardioprotective effect whenever there is an acute or chronic cardiac injury and specifically in the setting of myocardial I/R injury. The potential benefit in the emerging field of post cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS) is also mentioned. Indeed, electrical cVNS has a strong anti-adrenergic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, anti-apoptotic and pro-angiogenic effect; most of the involved molecular pathways were already directly confirmed to take place at the cardiac level for taVNS. Pre-clinical data clearly show that the sooner VNS is applied, the better the outcome, with the possibility of a marked infarct size reduction and almost complete left ventricular reverse remodelling when VNS is applied immediately before and during reperfusion. Finally, we describe in detail the limited but very promising clinical experience of taVNS in I/R injury available so far.",BIOELECTRONIC MEDICINE,2024,"Giannino, G; Nocera, L; Andolfatto, M; Braia, V; Giacobbe, F; Bruno, F; Saglietto, A; Angelini, F; De Filippo, O; D'Ascenzo, F; De Ferrari, GM; Dusi, V",10.1186/s42234-024-00153-6,,WOS:001484120900002,A

Traditionally, phenytoin and its prodrug fosphenytoin have been used as second-line therapies following benzodiazepines. However, intravenous levetiracetam has emerged as a promising alternative because of its favorable safety profile and ease of administration, particularly in pediatric populations. This study aimed to evaluate whether intravenous levetiracetam was non-inferior to intravenous fosphenytoin as a second-line treatment for managing pediatric status epilepticus.MethodsFrom November 2021 to May 2023, we implemented an updated local protocol that replaced fosphenytoin with levetiracetam as the second-line treatment for status epilepticus. Following this change, we conducted a 2-year multicenter study to evaluate its impact. For comparison, we also included patients treated under the previous protocol during the 2 years prior to the change, as a control group. An inverse probability of treatment weighting approach, based on the propensity score, was used to adjust for baseline characteristics between the two groups. Bayesian regression models were used to assess treatment effects in the weighted cohort. Treatment effectiveness was assessed using a composite measure of need for subsequent interventions, recurrence of status epilepticus within 24 h, seizure duration and length of hospital stay. We tested non-inferiority hypotheses for effectiveness criteria and if the probability of non-inferiority was greater than 95%, we also tested a superiority hypothesis. Safety was assessed by analyzing adverse events, mortality, admission to the intensive care unit, and transfer to the resuscitation unit. For safety criteria, only superiority was tested.ResultsIn total, 127 patients with status epilepticus were evaluated during the study period; 84 patients in the fosphenytoin group (66%) and 43 patients in the levetiracetam group (34%). Of these, 52 patients had febrile status epilepticus (40.9%), 27 patients were treated with oral levetiracetam as part of their daily treatment regimen at the time of status epilepticus (21.3%), and 12 (9.4%) patients had been treated with levetiracetam during their lifetime but stopped at the time of status epilepticus. With intravenous levetiracetam, 62.8% of children were seizure free, compared with 37.2% of children taking fosphenytoin. The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter with levetiracetam than with fosphenytoin (reduction of 1.9 days with levetiracetam) and children were less likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (reduction of 18.1% with levetiracetam). The need for third-line treatment or seizure recurrence was significantly lower in the levetiracetam group (16.3% reduction compared with fosphenytoin). Adverse effects and seizure duration were not significantly different between the two groups.ConclusionsUsing a composite outcome measure, we demonstrated that levetiracetam was not inferior to fosphenytoin with respect to seizure recurrence, the need for third-line therapy, intensive care unit admission, and the total length of hospital stays.",PEDIATRIC DRUGS,2025,"Hornard, A; Severac, F; Laugel, V; Wardé, MTA; Bansept, C; de Feraudy, Y; Haupt, S; Spitz, MA; Eyer, D; Martin, AD; Baer, S",10.1007/s40272-025-00709-2,,WOS:001523880100001,A

Methods: Mild and severe hemorrhagic shock were induced by total blood volume loss of 20% or 40%, respectively, which was maintained for 60 min. Then, resuscitation was performed by autologous blood and SAHA or a vehicle solution accordingly. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and arterial blood gas were measured during the experiment. Histological assays, wet/dry weight ratio, inflammatory cytokines, and the extent of histone acetylation were evaluated at 3 h post-resuscitation. Results: There were no significant differences of the most indicators measured between the mild hemorrhagic shock and Sham groups. Although in severe hemorrhagic shock group, mean arterial pressure was markedly reduced, lactic acid was significantly increased after hemorrhage. Moreover, the lung injury score was increased, the wet/dry weight ratio was elevated, inflammatory factor expression levels were upregulated, the expression of phosphorylated NF-kappa B/p65 was enhanced, and the extent of histone acetylation was decreased at 3 h post-resuscitation. Remarkably, adjuvant treatment with SAHA decreased the lactic acid, the pathological injury score, the wet/dry weight ratio, the content of inflammatory factor, as well as the level of activated NF-kappa B/p65, but promoted the expression of acetylated H4. Conclusions: Total blood volume loss of 40% results in acute lung injury, whereas loss of 20% does not.

Methods This retrospective study included patients with IO access presented in a level 1 trauma center emergency department (ED) between January 2015 and April 2020. Data regarding medication and fluid infusion was documented, and the clinical success rate was calculated. Results Of the 109,548 patients that were admitted to the ED, 25,686 IV lines were inserted. Documentation of 188 patients of which 73 (38.8%) children was complete and used for analysis. In these 188 patients, a total of 232 IO accesses were placed. Overall, 182 patients had a functional IO access (204 needles) (88%). In children (age < 18 years) success rate was lower as compared to adults, 71-84% as compared to 94%. However, univariate regression showed no association between the percentage of functional IO access and gender, age, weight, health care location (prehospital and in hospital), anatomical position (tibia as compared to humerus) or type of injury. Conclusion Intraosseous access demonstrates a high success rate for infusion, independent of gender, age, weight, anatomical positioning, or healthcare setting, with minimal complication rates. Caution is especially warranted for children under the age of six months, since success rate was lower.",BMC EMERGENCY MEDICINE,2024,"Rijnhout, TWH; Kieft, M; Klein, WM; Tan, ECTH",10.1186/s12873-024-01103-w,,WOS:001333489200002,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The effect of Glibenclamide on somatosensory evoked potentials after cardiac arrest in rats,"Background Science continues to search for a neuroprotective drug therapy to improve outcomes after cardiac arrest (CA). The use of glibenclamide (GBC) has shown promise in preclinical studies, but its effects on neuroprognostication tools are not well understood. We aimed to investigate the effect of GBC on somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) waveform recovery post CA and how this relates to the early prediction of functional outcome, with close attention to arousal and somatosensory recovery, in a rodent model of CA. Methods Sixteen male Wistar rats were subjected to 8-min asphyxia CA and assigned to GBC treatment (n = 8) or control (n = 8) groups. GBC was administered as a loading dose of 10 mu g/kg intraperitoneally 10 min after the return of spontaneous circulation, followed by a maintenance dosage of 1.6 mu g/kg every 8 h for 24 h. SSEPs were recorded from baseline until 150 min following CA. Coma recovery, arousal, and brainstem function, measured by subsets of the neurological deficit score (NDS), were compared between both groups. SSEP N10 amplitudes were compared between the two groups at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min post CA. Results Rats treated with GBC had higher sub-NDS scores post CA, with improved arousal and brainstem function recovery (P = 0.007). Both groups showed a gradual improvement of SSEP N10 amplitude over time, from 30 to 120 min post CA. Rats treated with GBC showed significantly better SSEP recovery at every time point (P < 0.001 for 30, 60, and 90 min; P = 0.003 for 120 min). In the GBC group, the N10 amplitude recovered to baseline by 120 min post CA. Quantified Cresyl violet staining revealed a significantly greater percentage of damage in the control group compared with the GBC treatment group (P = 0.004). Conclusions Glibenclamide improves coma recovery, arousal, and brainstem function after CA with decreased number of ischemic neurons in a rat model. GBC improves SSEP recovery post CA, with N10 amplitude reaching the baseline value by 120 min, suggesting early electrophysiologic recovery with this treatment.

However, their effect on arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) is not well established. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to evaluate the association between SGLT2i and the risk of arrhythmias and SCD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, HF, or chronic kidney disease. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search on PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus for relevant randomized controlled trials from inception until February 10, 2023. ORs and 95% CIs were pooled using a random effect model. RESULTS A total of 38 randomized controlled trials with 88,704 patients (48,435 in the SGLT2i group and 40,269 in the control group) were included in the study. The mean age of patients among SGLT2i and control groups was 56.8 and 56.7 years, respectively. The mean follow-up duration was 1.6 years. Pooled analysis of primary and secondary outcomes showed that SGLT2i significantly reduced the risk of incident atrial arrhythmia (OR: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75-0.98], P = 0.02), SCD (OR: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.55-0.94], P = 0.02) compared with placebo. However, the risk of ventricular arrhythmia (OR: 1.03 [95% CI: 0.84-1.26], P = 0.77) and cardiac arrest (OR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.72-1.23] P = 0.67) was comparable between both groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS SGLT2i therapy was associated with an overall lower risk of atrial arrythmia and SCD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or HF or chronic kidney disease. However, SGLT2i therapy was not associated with a lower risk of ventricular arrhythmia. (JACC Adv. 2025;4:101615) (c) 2025 The Authors.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Quantitative measures of EEG for prediction of outcome in cardiac arrest subjects treated with hypothermia: a literature review,"Cardiac arrest (CA) is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Early and accurate prediction of CA outcomecan help clinicians and families to make a better-informed decision for the patient's healthcare. Studies have shown that electroencephalography (EEG) may assist in early prognosis of CA outcome. However, visual EEG interpretation is subjective, labor-intensive, and requires interpretation by a medical expert, i.e., neurophysiologists. These limiting factors may hinder the applicability of such testing as the prognostic method in clinical settings. Automatic EEG pattern recognition using quantitative measures can make the EEG analysis more objective and less time consuming. It also allows to detect and display hidden patterns that may be useful for the prognosis over longer time periods of monitoring. Given these potential benefits, there have been an increasing interest over the last few years in the development and employment of EEG quantitative measures to predict CA outcome. This paper extensively reviews the definition and efficacy of various measures that have been employed for the prediction of outcome in CA subjects undergoing hypothermia (a neuroprotection method that has become a standard of care to improve the functional recovery of CA patients after resuscitation).

The review highlights the main findings of a selection of these trials and summarizes their impact on clinical practice. Recent findings Recent randomized studies examining the efficacy of revascularization or medical treatment in stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), treatment of acute coronary syndromes, emerging interventional devices, adjunctive pharmacotherapy, and intravascular imaging and physiology guidance have substantially advanced the evidenced-based knowledge in interventional cardiology. Patients with SIHD and at least moderate myocardial ischemia have similar event-free survival after an initial conservative strategy of optimal medical therapy versus an upfront invasive strategy. Quality of life and angina-free status are significantly improved with revascularization. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting provide similar 5-year outcomes in patients with left main coronary artery disease and low or intermediate disease complexity. An initially conservative management is equally effective as an early invasive approach in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ongoing ischemia. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and multivessel disease benefit from staged complete revascularization after primary PCI. Post-PCI, patients with atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulation can safely and effectively be treated with P2Y(12)inhibitor monotherapy without aspirin. Lastly, intravascular imaging guidance improves post-PCI outcomes, warranting increased use in clinical practice.",CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY,2020,"Galougahi, KK; Petrossian, G; Stone, GW; Ali, ZA",10.1097/HCO.0000000000000752,,WOS:000546355500003,A

This study aimed to assess PRC practices as reported by pediatricians who serve as instructors in the Brazilian Neonatal Resuscitation Program (BNRP) of the Brazilian Pediatric Society. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive survey among BNRP instructors. Data were collected via a 55-item online questionnaire (Google Forms), covering respondents' professional background, primary work setting, and specific PRC practices. A convenience sample was used, and descriptive statistics summarized the findings. Results A total of 740 responses were obtained, representing 63% of BNRP instructors. Of these, 79% were neonatologists, 88% with over 10 years of professional experience. Most worked in public (61%) and teaching hospitals (76%). Only 41% had received targeted PRC training; of these, 56% had exclusively theoretical instruction. Regarding the scope of PRC, 37% believed interventions were indicated solely for newborns requiring intubation, chest compression, or medications in the delivery room. Overall, 49% of respondents reported having written PRC protocols at their institutions, though their content and implementation varied considerably. Conclusion PRC practices in Brazil are neither homogeneous nor systematically implemented across most neonatology services involving BNRP instructors.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Shock to the Heart: Psychosocial Implications and Applications of Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young,"Purpose of ReviewAlthough rare, sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the young is a tragic event, having a dramatic impact upon all involved. The psychosocial burden associated with SCD can leave friends, families, and entire communities bereft. With only limited evidence to describe the volatile emotional reactions associated with a young SCD, there is an urgent need for care providers to better understand the psychological complexities and impacts faced by both at-risk individuals and those directly affected by these tragic events.Recent FindingsCurrent knowledge of the psychosocial implications associated with SCD in the young has recently generated interest in the cardiovascular community, with the goal of addressing prevention strategies (screening), family bereavement, and the psychological impact of at-risk or surviving individuals. With the emergence of novel strategies aimed at reducing the public health impact of SCD in the young, further discussion regarding the psychosocial impact of SCD, encompassing prevention, survivorship, and the downstream communal effects of a young death is required. Support systems and intervention could assist in the management of the associated psychosocial burden, yet there is a lack of clinical guidelines to direct this form of care.SummaryThere is an important need for multidisciplinary collaboration across subspecialties to provide support to grieving individuals and manage patient well-being throughout the screening process for SCD.

However, evidence regarding their correlation with in-hospital mortality among geriatric major trauma patients remains scarce in the literature. Methods: This analytical observational study employed a retrospective cohort design involving 82 geriatric major trauma patients treated at our institution between November 2023 and November 2024. Data were collected from patients' medical records at admission (age, trauma mechanism, vital signs, Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS], Injury Severity Score, hemoglobin, BD, and comorbidities) and at discharge (survival or death). Results: The geriatric major trauma patients who experienced in-hospital mortality were predominantly male, with an average age of 69.6 years. Traffic accidents constituted the most common trauma mechanism. Most patients presented with a GCS score between 13 and 15, and hypertension was the most frequently recorded comorbidity. BD demonstrated a significant correlation with in-hospital mortality (P<0.05). Severe BD was associated with the highest odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 40.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.90-560.86). Although age shock index did not directly correlate with mortality, it played a confounding role. Additionally, a GCS score of <9 was significantly correlated with in-hospital mortality (P<0.05).

The ratio of C-reactive protein (CRP) to the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was calculated and used to reflect patients' inflammatory status. Propensity score matching (PSM) was utilized to balance confounding factors between the low- and high-CRP/PNI groups. SFTS individuals from Jinyinhu Hospital were used as the validation cohort.ResultsPatients with SFTS and high CRP/PNI were significantly correlated with a higher percentage of severe and critical SFTS types and higher in-hospital mortality rates than those with low CRP/PNI. CRP/PNI was the potent risk indicator for in-hospital mortality in individuals with SFTS. The CRP/PNI nomogram showed a good predictive value for in-hospital mortality in patients with SFTS. After PSM, the predictive performance of CRP/PNI for 28-day mortality was excellent. Finally, the CRP/PNI could still assess patients with SFTS at different risks based on SFTS data from another medical center.ConclusionThe CPR/PNI ratio exhibited a strong positive correlation with the SFTS disease type and could predict in-hospital mortality in the early stages of SFTS.

Eligible articles compared neonatal outcomes in newborns receiving initial stabilization steps before and after cord clamping.ResultsTwelve studies met our inclusion criteria, with six RCTs included in the quantitative analysis. No statistically significant differences were found in delivery room parameters, in-hospital mortality, or neonatal outcomes between the examined groups.

Observations in bradyarrhythmic and asystolic arrests occurring from 1980-1982 are compared with those from 1975-1978. From 1980-1982, 61 (27%) of 225 cardiac arrest events meeting entry criteria for the study were bradyarrhythmic or asystolic. Only 2 (8%) of 24 patients with  asystole and 1 (20%) of 5 patients with sinus bradycardia survived prehospital intervention. Only 1 of these 29 patients was discharged from the hospital alive. Of 32 patients who presented with idioventricular rhythm at initial contact 15 (47%) survived prehospital intervention and were hospitalized, and 8 (25%) of these 32 were ultimately discharged alive. When compared with the 1975-1978 patients with bradyarrhythmia and asystole, both prehospital survival (8 vs. 30%, P < 0.001) and survival after hospitalization (0 vs. 15%, P < 0.05) significantly improved, but the improvement occurred predominantly in the subgroup with idioventricular rhythm. Survivors within this subgroup tended to have a prompt response to prehospital pharmacologic interventions that were not available to the 1975-1978 group. The response was manifested by return to a sinus mechanism or increase in the rate of idioventricular rhythm. Outcome has improved for a specific subgroup of victims of prehospital  cardiac arrest with bradyarrhythmia or asystole; the improved outcome may relate to field interventions by rescue personnel at the scene of arrest but the mortality rate is still high.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY,1984,"MYERBURG, RJ; ESTES, D; ZAMAN, L; LUCERI, RM; KESSLER, KM; TROHMAN, RG; CASTELLANOS, A",10.1016/S0735-1097(84)80130-8,,WOS:A1984TU35000007,A

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the quantitative analysis of EEG reactivity induced by standardized electrical stimulation and for early prognostication in this population.MethodsThis prospective observational study recruited post-CA comatose patients in Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University (Beijing, China) between January 2016 and June 2023. EEG reactivity to electrical or traditional pain stimulation was randomly performed via visual and quantitative analysis. Neurological outcome within 6 months was dichotomized as good (Cerebral Performance Categories, CPC 1-2) or poor (CPC 3-5).ResultsFifty-eight post-CA comatose patients were admitted, and 52 patients were included in the final analysis, of which 19 (36.5%) had good outcomes. EEG reactivity induced with the electrical stimulation had superior performance to the traditional pain stimulation for good outcome prediction (quantitative analysis: AUC 0.932 vs. 0.849, p = 0.048). When using the electrical stimulation, the AUC of EEG reactivity to predict good outcome by visual analysis was 0.838, increasing to 0.932 by quantitative analysis (p = 0.039). Comparing to the traditional pain stimulation by visual analysis, the AUC of EEG reactivity for good prognostication by the electrical stimulation with quantitative analysis was significantly improved (0.932 vs. 0.770, p = 0.004).ConclusionsEEG reactivity induced by the standardized electrical stimulation in combination with quantitative analysis is a promising formula for post-CA comatose patients, with increased predictive accuracy.",ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE,2024,"Liu, G; Wang, Y; Tian, F; Chen, WB; Cui, LL; Jiang, MD; Zhang, Y; Gao, KM; Su, YY; Wang, HX",10.1186/s13613-024-01339-6,,WOS:001257102000002,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The experiences of cardiac arrest survivors and their key supporters following cardiac arrest: A systematic review and meta-ethnography,"Aim: To review qualitative studies on the experience of sudden cardiac arrest survival from the perspective of both survivors and their key support Methods: A seven-step meta-ethnography and synthesis of qualitative evidence was undertaken, informed by the Meta-Ethnography Reporting Guidelines (eMERGe). Four major databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO; January 1995-January 2022, updated July 2023) for qualitative studies exploring survivors' and/or key supporters' experiences of cardiac arrest survival. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation - Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual) were applied to evaluate the overall confidence in research findings. Constructs were identified from each paper, informing theme and sub-theme development. Results: From 15,917 unique titles/abstracts and 196 full-text articles, 32 met the inclusion criteria. Three themes captured the survivors' experiences: 1) Making sense of my cardiac arrest; 2) Learning to trust my body and mind; and 3) Re-evaluating my life. A further three themes reflected key supporters' experiences: 1) Emotional turmoil; 2) Becoming a carer: same person but different me; and 3) Engaging with a new and unknown world. However, limited data and some methodological weaknesses in included studies reduced confidence in several themes. The findings were conceived within the overarching concept of 'negotiating a new normal'. Conclusions: The enduring psychosocial and physical sequelae of cardiac arrest survival substantially impacts the lives of survivors and their key supporters, requiring negotiation of their 'new normality'. The need for sense-making, physical and psychological recovery, and the new roles for key supporters should be strong considerations in the development of future interventions.",RESUSCITATION,2024,"Southern, C; Tutton, E; Dainty, KN; Seers, K; Pearson, NA; Couper, K; Ellard, DR; Perkins, GD; Haywood, KL",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2024.110188,,WOS:001225653600001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Endothelial -targeted CD39 is protective in a mouse model of global forebrain ischaemia,"Global ischemic brain injury occurs after cardiac arrest or prolonged hypotensive episodes following surgery or trauma. It causes significant neurological deficits even after successful re-establishment of blood flow. It is the primary cause of death in 68% of inpatient and 23% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases, but there are currently no treatments. Endothelial activation and dysfunction impairing small vessel blood flow is the cause of brain damage. Purinergic signaling is an endogenous molecular pathway, where CD39 and CD73 catabolize extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) to adenosine. After ischemia, eATP is released, triggering thrombosis and inflammation. In contrast, adenosine is anti-thrombotic, protects against oxidative stress, and suppresses the immune response. Our group developed a bifunctional compound - anti-VCAM-CD39 that targets the dysregulated endothelium and promotes adenosine generation at the infarct site, localising the antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of CD39. We investigated whether anti-VCAM-CD39 could improve outcome in a murine model of global ischaemia caused by dual carotid artery ligation (DCAL). Test drugs anti-VCAM-CD39 and controls were given 3 h after 30 min ischaemia. Assessments at 24 h included neurological function, infarct volume, perfusion, and albumin extravasation to assess blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. We showed that there was an overall improvement in neurological deficit in anti-VCAM-CD39-treated mice after DCAL. MRI revealed that these mice had significantly smaller infarcts and reduced apoptotic activity on the side of permanent occlusion, compared to saline treated mice. There was reduced albumin extravasation in treated mice after DCAL, suggesting anti-VCAM-CD39 conferred neuroprotection in the brain through preservation of BBB permeability. In vitro findings confirmed that anti-VCAM-CD39-mediated adenosine production protected against hypoxia-induced endothelial cell death. anti-VCAM-CD39 is a novel therapeutic that can promote neuroprotection, reduce tissue damage and inflammation after hypoxic brain injury in mice. These findings suggest that anti-VCAM-CD39 could be a new avenue of cardiac arrest therapy and could potentially be used in other cerebrovascular diseases where endothelial dysfunction is a constant underlying pathology.",JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION,2025,"Lee, NT; Savvidou, I; Selan, C; Wright, DK; Brkljaca, R; Chia, JSJ; Calvello, I; Craenmehr, DDD; Larsson, P; Tarlac, V; Vuong, A; Carmichael, I; Wang, XW; Peter, K; Robson, SC; Nandurkar, HH; Sashindranath, M",10.1186/s12974-025-03394-7,,WOS:001471781600001,A

The Portable Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) program promotes communication between clinicians and patients with advanced illness about EOL treatment preferences. Despite growing resources for EOL care, utilization remains unequal based on social determinants of health (SDOH), including race, language, urbanization, and education. We evaluated the relationship between POLST form selections and completion rates and SDOH. Methods: Oregon POLST Registry and American Community Survey data from 2013 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. POLST form completion rates and selections, and various SDOH, including age, income, insurance status, urbanization, etc. were recorded. Data were merged based on ZIP codes and analyzed using chi(2) or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests. Logistic regression was performed. Results: 127,588 POLST forms from 319 ZIP codes were included. POLST form completion rates were highest among urban ZIP codes, and urban registrants more often selected CPR and full treatment. ZIP codes with higher incomes tended to select CPR. ZIP codes with higher rates of private insurance completed POLST forms, and selected CPR and full treatment more frequently. ZIP codes with higher rates of Bachelor's degrees (or higher) completed POLST forms and selected full treatment more frequently. Conclusions: Various SDOH-specifically, urbanization, insurance status, income level and educational level achieved-may influence POLST form completion rates and selections.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Emergent Comprehensive Imaging of the Major Trauma Patient: A New Paradigm for Improved Clinical Decision-Making,"Modern advances in the medical imaging layered onto sophisticated trauma resuscitation strategies in highly organized regionalized trauma systems have created a paradigm shift in the management of severely injured patients. Although immediate exploratory surgery to identify and control life-threatening injuries still has its place, accelerated image acquisition and interpretation procedures now make it rare for trauma surgeons in major centers to venture into damage control surgery unaided by computed tomography (CT) or other imaging, particularly in cases of blunt trauma. Indeed, because of the high incidence of clinically occult injuries associated with major mechanism trauma, and even lower energy trauma in frail or elderly patients, CT imaging has become as invaluable as physical examination, if not more so, in critical decision-making in support of optimal outcomes. In particular, whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) completed promptly after initial assessment of a major trauma provides a quick, comprehensive survey of injuries that enables better surgical planning, obviates the need for multiple subsequent studies, and permits specialized reconstructions when needed. For those at risk for problematic occult injury after modest trauma, WBCT facilitates safer discharge planning and simplified follow-up. Through standardized guidelines, streamlined protocols, synoptic reporting, accessible web-based platforms, and active collaboration with clinicians, radiologists dedicated to trauma and emergency imaging enable clearer understanding of complex injuries in high-risk patients which leads to superior clinical decision-making. Whereas dated dogma has long warned that the CT scanner is the last place to take a challenging trauma patient, modern practice suggests that, more often than not, early comprehensive imaging can be done safely and efficiently and is in the patient's best interest.

However, the ability of AA to reduce mortality in critically ill patients remains controversial. In this study, we have performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of AA dose on the mortality of critically ill adults.MethodsElectronic databases were searched for trials in which AA had been intravenously administered to critically ill patients regardless of the dose or the co-administration of antioxidant agents. The predefined primary outcome included all-cause mortality at final follow-up.ResultsThe included trials enrolled a total of 1210 patients. Intravenous (IV) AA doses of 3-10g/d reduced the mortality of critically ill patients (OR 0.25; 95% CI (0.14-0.46); p<0.001; I-2=0.0%), while low (<3g/d) and high AA doses (10g/d) had no effect (OR 1.44; 95% CI (0.79-2.61); p=0.234; I-2=0.0% versus OR 1.12; 95% CI (0.62-2.03); p=0.700; I-2=0.0%). AA was associated with a decreased duration of vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation, but did not influence fluid requirement or urine output during the first 24h of admission. The number of patients suffering from acute kidney injury and the length of intensive care unit or hospital stays were also unaffected by the AA.ConclusionIntravenous AA reduces the duration of vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation; 3-10g AA results in lower overall mortality rates.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,"Drug resistant tuberculosis: Implications for transmission, diagnosis, and disease management","Drug resistant tuberculosis contributes significantly to the global burden of antimicrobial resistance, often consuming a large proportion of the healthcare budget and associated resources in many endemic countries. The rapid emergence of resistance to newer tuberculosis therapies signals the need to ensure appropriate antibiotic stewardship, together with a concerted drive to develop new regimens that are active against currently circulating drug resistant strains. Herein, we highlight that the current burden of drug resistant tuberculosis is driven by a combination of ongoing transmission and the intra-patient evolution of resistance through several mechanisms. Global control of tuberculosis will require interventions that effectively address these and related aspects. Interrupting tuberculosis transmission is dependent on the availability of novel rapid diagnostics which provide accurate results, as near-patient as is possible, together with appropriate linkage to care. Contact tracing, longitudinal follow-up for symptoms and active mapping of social contacts are essential elements to curb further community-wide spread of drug resistant strains. Appropriate prophylaxis for contacts of drug resistant index cases is imperative to limit disease progression and subsequent transmission. Preventing the evolution of drug resistant strains will require the development of shorter regimens that rapidly eliminate all populations of mycobacteria, whilst concurrently limiting bacterial metabolic processes that drive drug tolerance, mutagenesis and the ultimate emergence of resistance. Drug discovery programs that specifically target bacterial genetic determinants associated with these processes will be paramount to tuberculosis eradication. In addition, the development of appropriate clinical endpoints that quantify drug tolerant organisms in sputum, such as differentially culturable/detectable tubercle bacteria is necessary to accurately assess the potential of new therapies to effectively shorten treatment duration. When combined, this holistic approach to addressing the critical problems associated with drug resistance will support delivery of quality care to patients suffering from tuberculosis and bolster efforts to eradicate this disease.",FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY,2022,"Liebenberg, D; Gordhan, BG; Kana, BD",10.3389/fcimb.2022.943545,,WOS:000864937400001,A

This is a report on the pilot implementation of a nursing training programme aimed at strengthening safe perioperative nursing care in Nigeria, aligning with the nation's strategic framework for surgical, obstetric, anaesthesia, and nursing plan. The aim of this report is to highlight the need to incorporate perioperative nursing training into efforts to scale up access to surgical care in low resource settings.Methods The Nursing Care Saves Lives (NCSL) training programme which was designed for training in perioperative nursing of cleft lip and palate patients, was adapted for perioperative nursing training. A 5-day intensive training was deployed, involving lectures, hands-on activities, simulations, and group problem-solving exercises. Pre- and post-training surveys were administered, and participant feedback and 3-months follow-up assessments obtained. The data has been analysed using descriptive statistics.Results Twenty-six participants who were nurses involved in perioperative care, from both public and private hospitals, completed the training. Pre-training evaluation scores ranged from 23 to 72% (median 68%), increasing significantly to 61-98% (median 76%) post-training (p = 0.0001). Participants rated all training contents as useful, with high satisfaction in neonatal resuscitation and basic life support skills. Infection prevention and control, helping babies breathe, and effective communication were identified as key learnings. Recommendations for future training included facilitation skills, nutrition, and research. Although 10 (40%) participants organised step down trainings, limited funding and training materials were key barriers to step down.Conclusion The NCSL training programme has the potential for promoting and strengthening safe perioperative nursing care.

Methods: The electronic health records of adult CKD patients admitted between August 2018 and February 2020 were retrospectively reviewed to identify CKD patients with >1 hospitalisation and length of hospital stay >4 days. Outcome measures were mortality and the duration of hospitalisation. We also assessed the utility of the Cohen's model to predict 6-month mortality among CKD patients. Results: A total of 442 patients (mean age 68.6 years) with median follow-up of 15.3 months were identified. The mean (standard deviation) Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] was 6.8 +/- 2.0 with 48.4% on chronic dialysis. The overall mortality rate until August 2020 was 36.7%. Mortality was associated with age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.77), CCI> 7 (1.58, 1.08-2.30), lower serum albumin (1.09, 1.06-1.11), readmission within 30-day (1.96, 1.43-2.68) and CKD non-dialysis (1.52, 1.04-2.17). Subgroup analysis of the patients within first 6-month from index admission revealed longer hospitalisation stay for those who died (CKD-non dialysis: 5.5; CKD-dialysis: 8.0 versus 4 days for those survived, P<0.001).

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Association of Rapid Response Teams With Hospital Mortality in Medicare Patients,"Background: Although rapid response teams have been widely promoted as a strategy to reduce unexpected hospital deaths, most studies of rapid response teams have not adjusted for secular trends in mortality before their implementation. We examined whether implementation of a rapid response team was associated with a reduction in hospital mortality after accounting for preimplementation mortality trends. Methods: Among 56 hospitals in Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation linked to Medicare, we calculated the annual rates of case mix-adjusted mortality for each hospital during 2000 to 2014. We constructed a hierarchical log-binomial regression model of mortality over time (calendar-year), incorporating terms to capture the effect of rapid response teams, to determine whether implementation of rapid response teams was associated with reduction in hospital mortality that was larger than expected based on preimplementation trends, while adjusting for hospital case mix index. Results: The median annual number of Medicare admissions was 5214 (range, 408-18 398). The median duration of preimplementation and postimplementation period was 7.6 years (approximate to 2.5 million admissions) and 7.2 years (approximate to 2.6 million admissions), respectively. Hospital mortality was decreasing by 2.7% annually during the preimplementation period. Implementation of rapid response teams was not associated with a change in mortality during the initial year (relative risk for model intercept, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.94-1.02]; P=0.30) or in the mortality trend (relative risk for model slope, 1.01 per year [95% CI, 0.99-1.02]; P=0.30). Among individual hospitals, implementation of a rapid response team was associated with a lower-than-expected mortality at only 4 (7.1%) and higher-than-expected mortality at 2 (3.7%) hospitals. Conclusions: Among a large and diverse sample of US hospitals, we did not find implementation of rapid response teams to be associated with reduction in hospital mortality. Studies are needed to understand best practices for rapid response team implementation, to ensure that hospital investment in these teams improves patient outcomes.",CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES,2022,"Girotra, S; Jones, PG; Peberdy, MA; Vaughan-Sarrazin, MS; Chan, PS",10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.122.008901,,WOS:000854153100002,A

Its incidence and perinatal risk factors in preterm infants might differ from those in term infants. We investigated the incidence, perinatal risk factors and morbidities associated with pulmonary air leak in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants in Taiwan. Methods Data from 2011 to 2015 from the nationwide multihospital registry of the Taiwan Premature Infant Follow-up Network were analyzed. Preterm infants with pulmonary air leak, including pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, were enrolled. Data on perinatal characteristics, the course of resuscitation in the delivery room, the management of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and the clinical outcomes of pulmonary air leak were collected and compared between VLBW preterm infants with and without pulmonary air leak. Results We included 5906 VLBW preterm infants with a mean gestational age of 28.6 +/- 3 weeks and mean birth weight of 1078 +/- 284 g. Of them, 379 neonates (6.4%) had pulmonary air leak, with 5.4% and 1% having isolated pneumothorax and isolated pneumomediastinum, respectively. Independent risk factors for pulmonary air leak in VLBW preterm infants were male sex, a 5-min Apgar score <7, and RDS treated with surfactant. VLBW preterm infants who had higher gestational age or received nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) had a lower risk of pulmonary air leak. However, pulmonary air leak was associated with higher rates of severe retinopathy of prematurity, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung disease, and mortality. Conclusions NCPAP appeared to protect against pulmonary air leak in VLBW preterm infants. Clinicians should be aware of the risk factors for pulmonary air leak in such infants and promptly initiate meticulous ventilation strategies as needed.",PEDIATRICS AND NEONATOLOGY,2025,"Wang, SH; Hung, YL; Shen, CM; Hsieh, WS",10.1016/j.pedneo.2024.05.006,,WOS:001522623600015,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Identifying potential three key targets gene for septic shock in children using bioinformatics and machine learning methods,"Background Septic shock in children is an infectious disease caused by low immunity, and its mortality is very high. Early prediction of the risk of death in children with septic shock is helpful for clinicians to judge the severity of the disease, take active treatment measures, and improve the adverse outcomes of patients. However, the mechanism of death from sepsis in children remains unclear. This study aims to use bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms to identify key genes and pathways associated with fatal sepsis in children, and provide theoretical basis for rational drug use in follow-up TCM treatment.Methods Gene expression profiles were obtained from the GEO database (GSE4607) for 15 blank patients and 14 children with sepsis death. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched by GO and KEGG pathways. Construct and visualize protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to identify candidate genes responsible for fatal sepsis in children. Three kinds of machine learning models were established, and the candidate genes were screened by intersection to obtain the core genes with diagnostic value. ROC curve was drawn for core genes to clarify the diagnostic value of genetic markers.Results Analysis of differences in the preprocessed dataset identified 83 genes, including 78 up-regulated genes and 5 down-regulated genes. 17 candidate genes were screened by protein interaction network analysis. Three machine learning algorithms LASSO, random forest (RF), and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) were used to finally screen out three core genes: CD163, MCEMP1 and RETN. CD163, MCEMP1 and RETN may jointly regulate complement and coagulation cascades, toll like receptor signaling pathway, graft versus host disease, type I diabetes mellitus.Conclusion In this study, three core genes (CD163, MCEMP1 and RETN) that lead to sepsis death in children were screened out, providing a new understanding of the lethal mechanism of sepsis in children and a promising new therapeutic approach.",FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY,2025,"Guo, W; Chen, H; Wang, F; Chi, YJ; Zhang, W; Wang, S; Chen, KZ; Chen, H",10.3389/fimmu.2025.1586584,,WOS:001520202100001,A

Design This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial with parallel arms. Methods The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the participating hospital on 1 August 2018. Frail elders and their carer if any are enrolled during hospitalization, and undergo randomization after discharged. The intervention group receives a 2-week video-supported nurse-led advance care planning programme (N = 149) while the control group receives a 2-week health education program at home (N = 149). Follow-up surveys via telephone at 1 and 6 months measure outcomes regarding end-of-life decision-making from both the patients and the carers. Conclusion Advance care planning discussion is to understand patient's values, preferences and treatment for care on their anticipation of future deterioration. Treatment options for end-of-life care may not be well-received especially elders because in the discussion process, technical medical terms are presented in an abstract, hypothetical way that are hard to understand. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of a nurse-led advance care planning supplementing with a video showing end-of-life treatment options to promote end-of-life care decision-making among frail geriatric patients.

This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical features, early and late outcomes, and prognostic factors in patients undergoing aortic repair surgery for ATAAD complicated with preoperative shock. Methods<br /> Between April 2007 and July 2020, 694 consecutive patients underwent emergency ATAAD repair at our institution, including 162 (23.3%) presenting with preoperative shock (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg), who were classified into the survivor (n = 125) and non-survivor (n = 37) groups according to whether they survived to hospital discharge. The clinical demographics, surgical information, and postoperative complications were compared. Five-year survival and freedom from reoperation rates of survivors were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier actuarial method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Results<br /> The in-hospital surgical mortality rate in patients with ATAAD and shock was 22.8%. The non-survivor group showed higher rates of preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction, and was associated with longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, higher rates of total arch replacement and intraoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation implementation. The non-survivor group had higher blood transfusion volumes and rates of malperfusion-related complications. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative cardiopulmonary resuscitation, prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time, and total arch replacement were risk factors for in-hospital mortality. For patients who survived to discharge, the 5-year cumulative survival and freedom from aortic reoperation rates were 75.6% (95% confidence interval, 67.6%-83.6%) and 82.6% (95% confidence interval, 74.2%-91.1%), respectively. Conclusions<br /> Preoperative shock in ATAAD is associated with a high risk of in-hospital mortality, particularly in patients who undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation and complex aortic repair procedures with extended cardiopulmonary bypass.

The purpose of this publication is to highlight the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges associated with acute liver failure in pregnant women. Methods: The patient presented with jaundice, pruritus, and dark-colored urine. Laboratory tests revealed a significant increase in aminotransferase, bilirubin, and bile acid levels, suggesting liver problems; however, due to the patient's rapidly deteriorating condition and test results, autoimmune hepatitis was considered. Viral infections and other causes of liver damage were excluded. No clear diagnosis was established. The patient was administered ursodeoxycholic acid and due to her worsening condition, a cesarean section was performed at 23 weeks of gestation. After delivery, the patient's condition improved, although she did experience cardiac arrest during hospitalization. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of acute liver failure in the course of an overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary cholangitis or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. No abnormalities were noted during a follow-up visit 6 weeks after delivery. Despite a detailed case analysis, a final diagnosis was not established, which complicates planning for future pregnancies. Discussion: Several liver conditions can occur during pregnancy, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, primary biliary cholangitis, and autoimmune hepatitis. Diagnosing these conditions can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms and metabolic and immunological adaptations during pregnancy that can affect the course of liver diseases. Rapid intervention is crucial to protect the health of both the mother and the fetus.

With approximately 55 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests per 100 000 people annually, survival rates hinge on timely cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emphasising its initiation within a 4-6 min window. Trauma, causing 6 million deaths and nearly 40 million injuries a year, further underscores the need for prompt prehospital care. Acknowledging these challenges, health systems have incorporated community first responder (CFR) models, where trained community members provide initial aid, aiming to bridge the crucial gap until professional help arrives. This scoping review intends to explore the experiences of various countries with CFR models, including their conceptual and theoretical frameworks, recognising CFR as a critical solution for reducing response times in prehospital emergency care. Methods and analysis Arksey and O'Malley's approach will be followed in this scoping review.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,A case report of a brain herniation secondary to cryptococcal meningitis with elevated intracranial pressure in a patient with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS),"Background: Cryptococcal meningitis is a major opportunistic infection in individuals with HIV. The worldwide annual incidence is estimated to be approximately one million cases per year, with the most significant burden in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis continues to have a high mortality rate despite widespread availability and use of HAART. Case: 36-year-old male with a past medical history of AIDS and a CD4 count of 35 cells/mm3 presented with altered mental status initially thought to be related to using crystalline methamphetamine as reported by EMS. However, a lumbar puncture performed in the emergency department showed elevated CSF opening pressure of 29 cmH2O and positive CSF and serum cryptococcal antigen. The patient was admitted and commenced treatment according to the current IDSA guideline but continued to have waxing and waning mental status. On the fourth day of admission, he complained of headache, had a witnessed seizure, and was taken emergently for a CT scan of the brain, which was negative for any acute intracranial process, but suffered a cardiac arrest before it could be done. He was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. CT brain follow-up showed anoxic encephalopathy, development of marked cerebral edema, and complete effacement of the basilar cisterns, suggestive of downward transtentorial herniation; he continued to deteriorate and expired on the seventh day of admission.Objectives:1.

Twenty-two hours post-CLP and prior to resuscitation (t = 22 h), animals were randomized to resuscitation with normal saline (NS, 10 cc/kg/h) or pooled rat fresh frozen plasma (FFP, 3.33 cc/kg/h). Resuscitation under general anesthesia proceeded for the next 6 h (t = 22 h to t = 28 h); lactate was checked every 2 h, and fluid volumes were titrated based on lactate clearance. Blood samples were obtained before (t = 22 h) and after resuscitation (t = 28 h), and at death or study conclusion. Lung specimens were obtained for calculation of wet-to-dry weight ratio. Fisher exact test was used to analyze the primary outcome of 48-h survival. ANOVA with repeated measureswas used to analyze the effect of FFP versus NS resuscitation on blood gas, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, catecholamines, and syndecan-1 (marker for endothelial injury). A two-tailed alpha level of < 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. Results: Thirty-three animals were studied: 14 FFP, 14 NS, and 5 sham. Post-CLP but preresuscitation (t = 22 h) variables between FFP and NS animals were similar and significantly deranged compared with sham animals. FFP significantly increased 48-h survival compared to NS (n = 8 [57%] vs n = 2 [14%]), attenuated the post-resuscitation (t = 28 h) levels of epinephrine (mean 2.2 vs 7.0 ng/mL), norepinephrine, (3.8 vs 8.9 ng/mL), IL-6 (3.8 vs 18.7 ng/mL), and syndecan-1 (21.8 vs 31.0 ng/mL) (all P < 0.05), improved the post-resuscitation PO2 to FiO(2) ratio (353 vs 151), and reduced the pulmonary wet-to-dry weight ratio (5.28 vs 5.94) (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared to crystalloid, plasma resuscitation increased 48-h survival in a rat sepsis model, improved pulmonary function and decreased pulmonary edema, and attenuated markers for inflammation, endothelial injury, and catecholamines.",SHOCK,2018,"Chang, R; Holcomb, JB; Johansson, PI; Pati, S; Schreiber, MA; Wade, CE",10.1097/SHK.0000000000000918,,WOS:000429307300009,A

Early and effective emergency care throughout the pre-hospital and in-hospital period is the key to reducing the rate of death and disability and promoting the recovery of patients. In this study, we conducted an observational study of 130 patients with acute craniocerebral injury admitted between May 2020 and May 2021. Patients were randomly divided into a regular group and an optimization group of 65 patients each, with patients in the regular group receiving the conventional emergency care model and patients in the optimization group receiving the pre-hospital and in-hospital optimal emergency care process for intervention. In this study, we observed and compared the time taken to arrive at the scene, assess the condition, attend to the patient and provide emergency care, the success rate of emergency care within 48 h, the interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) after admission and 1 day before discharge, the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36) after resuscitation and 1 day before discharge, and the complications of infection, brain herniation, central hyperthermia, and electrolyte disturbances in both groups. We collected and statistically analyzed the recorded data. The results showed that the time taken to arrive at the consultation site, assess the condition, receive the consultation, provide first aid was significantly lower in the optimized group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the success rate of treatment was significantly higher in the optimized group than in the regular group (P < 0.05). In both groups, IL-6, IL-8, and ICAM-1 decreased on the day before discharge compared with the day of rescue, with the levels of each index lower in the optimization group than in the regular group (P < 0.05); the NIHSS scores decreased and the SF-36 scores increased on the day before discharge compared with the successful rescue in both groups, with the NIHSS scores in the optimization group lower than in the regular group and the SF-36 scores higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). The overall complication rate in the optimization group was significantly lower than that in the regular group (P < 0.05).

Objective: To describe the study protocol for the 'Balanced Electrolyte Solution versus Saline Trial for Diabetic Ketoacidosis' (BEST-DKA) trial. Design, setting and participants: BEST-DKA is a Phase 3 cluster-crossover, blinded, pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial comparing the effects of saline or buffered crystalloid solution in patients with moderate to severe DKA treated in the emergency department and/or intensive care unit at twenty hospitals in Australia. Each hospital will be randomised to use either saline or buffered crystalloid solution for a period of 12 months before crossing over to the alternate fluid for the next 12 months. The blinded study fluid will be used for all resuscitation and maintenance purposes for included patients. Main outcome measures: This cluster-randomised, crossover randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been designed with the aim of enrolling a minimum of 400 patients, which will provide >91.4% power to detect a 2-day increase in the primary outcome, days alive and out of hospital to day 28, chosen with consumer representation. Secondary outcomes include quality of life and fatigue scores at day 28, intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, acute kidney injury, and time to resolution of DKA. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. A prespecified statistical analysis plan will be developed prior to interim analysis. Results and conclusion: The BEST-DKA trial commenced enrolment in March 2024 and should generate results that will determine whether treatment with Plasma-Lyte (R) 148, compared with saline, results in increased days alive, and out of hospital to day 28 for patients with moderate or severe DKA.

Frailty is an emerging concept in medicine yet to be explored as a risk factor in cardiac surgery. When it comes to CABG surgery, randomized controlled clinical trials have primarily focused on low-risk (ROOBY, CORONARY), elevated-risk (GOPCABE) or high-risk patients (BBS), but not on frail patients. Therefore, we believe that off-pump CABG could be an important technique in patients with limited functional capacity to respond to surgical stress.

Despite international promulgation, the uptake of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Hour-1 Bundle (lactate measurement, blood culture, broad-spectrum antibiotics, 30 mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension/lactate >= 4 mmol/L and vasopressors for hypotension during/after fluid resuscitation within 1 hour of sepsis recognition) is low across healthcare settings. Delays in sepsis recognition and a lack of high-quality evidence hinder its implementation. We propose a novel sepsis care model (National Early Warning Score, NEWS-1 care), in which the SSC Hour-1 Bundle is triggered objectively by a high NEWS-2 (>= 5). This study aims to determine the feasibility of a full-scale type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial on the NEWS-1 care in multiple EDs. Methods and analysis We will conduct a pilot type 1 hybrid trial and prospectively recruit 200 patients from 4 public EDs in Hong Kong cluster randomised in a stepped wedge design over 10 months. All study sites will start with an initial period of standard care and switch in random order at 2-month intervals to the NEWS-1 care unidirectionally.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Iranian Critical Care Nurses' Experiences With Slow Codes in the Absence of Formal 'Do-Not-Resuscitate' Orders: A Qualitative Study,"Background: Sudden cardiac death remains a critical global health issue, with cardiopulmonary resuscitation serving as a vital life-saving intervention. However, ethical dilemmas emerge when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is unlikely to benefit the patient, particularly in settings lacking formal Do-Not-Resuscitate orders. This situation often leads to ambiguous practices such as 'slow codes', raising complex challenges for critical care nurses involved in end-of-life decision-making. Aim: This study aims to explore the experiences of Iranian critical care nurses with slow code practices in the absence of formal Do-Not-Resuscitate orders. Study Design: This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled nurses from diverse intensive care units (medical, pulmonary, poisoning, surgical and cardiac) across three teaching hospitals. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis framework. Results: Sixteen participants took part in the study. They had a mean age of 36.8 years (SD = 5.9) and professional experience ranging from 6 to 23 years (M = 13 years), with 2-15 years in intensive care (M = 8.5 years). Most were female (75%), married (75%) and held a bachelor's degree (68.8%). Six key themes emerged influencing slow code practices: fear of litigation and criticism, stretching and buying time, post-resuscitation care and quality of life, opportunities for gaining resuscitation expertise, emotional struggles and moral disengagement. These findings highlight the complex ethical and practical dilemmas nurses face, where legal ambiguities and resource constraints significantly affect end-of-life care decisions. Conclusions: Nurses often initiate slow codes due to fear of litigation and the desire to support families, while confronting moral dilemmas and concerns about patient outcomes. These findings highlight the urgent need for formal legal frameworks on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders and enhanced nurse training to effectively address the ethical complexities of end-of-life care. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Resuscitation decisions must align with updated clinical guidelines, underscoring the need for formal national and local frameworks on Do-Not-Resuscitate orders in Iran. Legislation that reduces nurses' fear of litigation is essential to promote confident, ethically grounded decision-making. Furthermore, enhancing healthcare professionals' communication skills is critical to improving patients' and families' understanding of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",NURSING IN CRITICAL CARE,2025,"Moghbeli, G; Roshangar, F; Soheili, A; Ahmadi, F; Feizollahzadeh, H; Hassankhani, H",10.1111/nicc.70224,,WOS:001629797800027,A

Aims and hypothesis This is a clinical trial designed to study the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a protocol of targeted temperature management to moderate hypothermia in intracerebral hemorrhage patients. Methods The targeted temperature management after intracerebral hemorrhage trial is a prospective, single-center, interventional, randomized, parallel, two-arm (1:1) phase-II clinical trial with blinded end-point ascertainment. Intracerebral hemorrhage patients will be randomized within 18h of symptom onset to either 72h of targeted temperature management to moderate hypothermia (32-34 degrees C) followed by a controlled rewarming at of 0 center dot 05-0 center dot 1 degrees C per hour or 72h of targeted temperature management to normothermia (36-37 degrees C) using endovascular or surface cooling. Outcomes The primary outcome is the development of serious adverse events possibly and probably related to treatment. Secondary outcomes include in-hospital neurological deterioration between day 0-7, in-hospital mortality, functional outcome measured by the modified Rankin scale at discharge and 90 days, and effect of treatment allocation on cerebral edema and hematoma volume. Discussion Intracerebral hemorrhage remains the most severe form of stroke with limited options to improve survival. As the early resuscitation phase in the intensive care unit represents the greatest opportunity for impact on clinical outcome, it also appears to be the most promising window of opportunity to demonstrate a benefit when investigating aggressive treatments.

This study aimed to characterize the distribution, and predictive performance, of four vital signs selected based on Australian guidelines (oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and heart rate); with those of the MER activation criteria.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted including patients admitted under general surgical services of two hospitals in South Australia over 2 years. Likelihood ratios for patients meeting MER activation criteria, or a vital sign in the most extreme 1% for general surgery inpatients ( 99.5th percentile), were calculated to predict in-hospital mortality.Results: 15 969 inpatient admissions were included comprising 2 254 617 total vital sign observations.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,In vitro comparison of cold-stored whole blood and reconstituted whole blood,"Background and Objectives: Cold-stored whole blood (CSWB) is increasingly used in damage control resuscitation. Haemostatic function of CSWB seems superior to that of reconstituted whole blood, and it is sufficiently preserved for 14-21 days. To provide evidence for a yet insufficiently studied aspect of prehospital CSWB use, we compared in vitro haemostatic properties of CSWB and currently used in-hospital and prehospital blood component therapies.Materials and Methods: Blood was obtained from 24 O RhD positive male donors. Three products were prepared: CSWB, in-hospital component therapy (red blood cells [RBCs], OctaplasLG and platelets 1:1:1) and prehospital component therapy (RBCs and lyophilized plasma 1:1). Samples were drawn on days 1 and 14 of CSWB or RBC cold storage. On day 14, platelet concentrates at their expiry (5 days) were used for 1:1:1 mixing. Conventional clotting assays, rotational thromboelastometry, thrombin formation and platelet function were assessed.Results: Haemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen and coagulation factor levels remained closest to physiological in CSWB. Factor VIII activity decreased markedly by day 14 in CSWB. The decline in platelet function was prominent in CSWB. However, CSWB on day 14 yielded physiological EXTEM MCF, suggesting haemostatically sufficient platelet function. Despite haemodilution and lower coagulation factor levels, in-hospital component therapy was haemostatically adequate. Prehospital component therapy formed the weakest clots. Thrombin formation potential remained comparable and stable in all groups.Conclusion: Current prehospital component therapy fails to offer the clotting potential that CSWB does. CSWB and current in-hospital 1:1:1 component therapy show similar haemostatic potential until 14 days of storage.",VOX SANGUINIS,2023,"Susila, S; Helin, T; Lauronen, J; Joutsi-Korhonen, L; Ilmakunnas, M",10.1111/vox.13441,,WOS:000986637900001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Dynamic progression of Wernicke encephalopathy in a gastric cancer patient: Multimodal MRI insights with arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging,"Rationale: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE), a neurological emergency caused by thiamin deficiency, is traditionally diagnosed based on the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion. However, this classic presentation occurs in fewer than 10% of cases, complicating early recognition. Untreated cases risk irreversible brain damage or progression to Korsakoff syndrome. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids diagnosis, early-stage structural abnormalities may be subtle or absent. Arterial spin labeling (ASL), a noninvasive perfusion imaging technique, offers potential for detecting microcirculatory changes preceding cytotoxic edema. This case explores ASL's diagnostic utility in WE through a high-risk patient with atypical progression. Patient concerns: A 50-year-old female with gastric adenocarcinoma developed persistent vomiting following chemotherapy. By hospital day 9, she rapidly deteriorated into a comatose state (Glasgow Coma Scale: E1V1M3), prompting neurological evaluation. No classic WE triad features were initially documented. Diagnoses: Brain MRI revealed bilateral thalamic, periventricular, and periaqueductal gray matter hyperintensities on T2-FLAIR/DWI. ASL perfusion imaging demonstrated elevated cerebral blood flow (CBF) in these regions, extending to frontal and parietal lobes. Follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed lesion progression involving cortical and medullary areas, with ASL hyperperfusion exceeding diffusion-restricted zones. Serum thiamin levels (<1 ng/mL) confirmed deficiency, establishing WE diagnosis. Interventions : Initial supportive care: Vasopressors, fluid resuscitation, methylprednisolone (40 mg/day), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor critical intervention delay: Thiamine replacement deferred until day 11 due to pending laboratory confirmation family-directed care: Against medical advice, transferred to local hospital prior to initiating high-dose IV thiamin. Outcomes: Radiological progression: Lesion expansion from deep gray matter to cortical/medullary regions within 48 hours Therapeutic uncertainty: Final neurological recovery status unreported due to care discontinuity. Lessons: ASL may identify perfusion alterations prior to DWI-detectable cytotoxic edema, suggesting a role in WE's early diagnostic algorithm. Rapid lesion progression in high-risk patients necessitates urgent thiamin repletion even without classic symptoms. Neuroimaging findings in WE may exhibit dynamic spatial-temporal evolution, requiring multimodal imaging interpretation. Serum thiamin levels remain critical for diagnostic confirmation in radiologically ambiguous cases.",MEDICINE,2025,"Li, ZG; Min, QC; Chen, JD; Chen, BY; Chen, WM; Su, JX; Zhu, LH",10.1097/MD.0000000000043580,,WOS:001548114900028,A

Therefore, prompt diagnosis, initiate appropriate antibiotics and other supportive treatments are critical. Here we reported a case of STSS caused by group A streptococcus infection. A healthy 39-year-old man presented a sudden pain in the left lower extremity, followed by a high fever (40.0 degrees C) with dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Twenty-four hours before the visit, the patient showed anuria. The patient was then admitted to the intensive care unit. Blood examination revealed elevated levels of inflammatory markers and creatinine. He suffered from septic shock, dysfunction of coagulation, acute kidney dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute liver function injury. The diagnosis was obtained through clinical manifestation and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) drawn from the pustule and deep soft tissue (lower limb) samples while all bacterial cultures came back negative. The pustule mNGS report detected a total of 132 unique group A streptococcus sequence reads, representing 96.3% of microbial reads while the soft tissue mNGS report identified a total of 142474 unique group A streptococcus sequence reads, representing 100% of microbial reads. The patient was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, antibiotics comprising piperacillin/tazobactam and clindamycin, respiratory support, following the delayed surgical debridement. Intravenous immunoglobulin was also used for 5 days. On the 14th day after admission, he was transferred to the general ward for follow-up treatment. Our case highlighted, for the first time, the key role of mNGS in the early diagnosis of culture-negative invasive group A streptococcal infection.

Eight patients with idiopathic VF were compared with eight normal subjects (controls) by [(123)] I metaiodobenzylguanidine SPECT (MIBG), measuring peak uptake, late uptake, and clearance of the nuclear tracer. The left ventricle was divided in 13 segments in the bull's-eye target plot. Peak and late MIBG uptake was increased in the anterolateral segments (2,3,7,8) compared to the inferoposterior and septal segments, in controls and in patients. No difference was observed between controls and patients in the inferoposterior and septal segments. In contrast, a significantly higher MIBG uptake was observed in patients compared to controls in the anterolateral segments (94 4% vs 81 +/- 11%, P < 0.03 for peak uptake; 94 +/- 5% vs 79 +/- 12%, P < 0.01 forlate uptake). No difference was observed in MIBG clearance in any segment in either study group. Cardiac sympathetic innervation is highly heterogeneous, though predominant in anterolateral segments in normal subjects. Patients with idiopathic VF exhibit the same distribution, though have a significantly greater density of sympathetic terminals in the anterolateral segments than controls, which may promote ventricular arrhythmias.

It has been shown that a positive fluid balance has a major impact on postoperative outcome. Today, the advantages and disadvantages of buffered crystalloid solutes are a topic of controversy, with no consensus being reached so far. The use of hypertonic saline (HS) has shown promising results with respect to lower total fluid balance and postoperative weight gain in critically ill patients in preliminary studies. However, collection of more data on HS in critically ill patients seems warranted. This preliminary study aims to investigate whether fluid resuscitation using HS in patients following cardiac surgery results in less total fluid volume being administered.MethodsIn a prospective double-blind randomised controlled clinical trial, we aim to recruit 96 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery for ischaemic and/or valvular heart disease. After postoperative admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), patients will be randomly assigned to receive 5ml/kg ideal body weight HS (7.3% NaCl) or normal saline (NS, 0.9% NaCl) infused within 60min. Blood and urine samples will be collected preoperatively and postoperatively up to day 6 to assess changes in renal, cardiac, inflammatory, acid-base, and electrolyte parameters. Additionally, we will perform renal ultrasonography studies to assess renal blood flow before, during, and after infusion, and we will measure total body water using preoperative and postoperative body composition analysis (bioimpedance). Patients will be followed up for 90days.DiscussionThe key objective of this study is to assess the cumulative amount of fluid administered in the intervention (HS) group versus control (NS) group during the ICU stay. In this preliminary, prospective, randomised controlled clinical trial we will test the hypothesis that use of HS results in less total fluids infused and less postoperative weight gain when compared to the standard of intensive care in cardiac surgery patients.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03280745.

The aim of this study was to characterize the exact mechanism of Guizhi Fuling Wan action and whether it is related to the regulation of intestinal flora structure. We induced PCOS-IR rat model by means of letrozole sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-na) solution combined with high-fat emulsion administration and randomly divided it into blank control group (K), model control group (M), low dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (D), middle dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (Z), high dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (G) and positive drug (Metformin) control group (Y).

Although clinical practice has demonstrated a benefit of protecting patients for a period as long as 3-6 months with such devices, the current European guidelines concerning ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are still extremely restrictive in the patient selection in part because of the costs derived from such a prevention device, in part because of the lack of robust randomised trials. To illustrate expanded use cases for the WCD, four real-life clinical cases are presented where patients received the device slightly outside the established guidelines.

Hind-limb paralysis is a common deficit caused by global ischemia. Until recently, most studies of global ischemia of the central nervous system have examined either the brain or spinal cord, but not both. Spinal cord damage specifically after global ischemia has not been studied in detail. Because the exact nature of the neuronal damage to the spinal cord and the differences in neuronal damage between the brain and spinal cord after global ischemia are poorly understood, we developed a new global ischemia model in the rat and specifically studied spinal cord damage after global ischemia.

Various noninvasive methods such as determination of left ventricular function or heart rate variability as well as invasive electrophysiologic testing are currently used for risk stratification. Noninvasive measurement of microvolt. T wave alternans (TWA) is a promising new method to assess repolarization abnormalities; in experimental studies, TWA was associated with an increased incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Since the occurrence of TWA is heart rate-dependent, it is measured either during atrial pacing or during exercise stress testing. The first clinical validation of the method was performed in patients undergoing invasive EP testing to assess prediction of inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A first prospective validation of the noninvasive method was performed in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest fitted with an ICD. Further studies have shown a good concordance between invasive and noninvasive TWA determination. The occurrence of TWA in this population was of predictive Value with respect to arrhythmia recurrence. Recently published data confirm the value of TWA assessment with respect to identification of patients with congestive heart failure at high risk of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Epidemiologic Characteristics and Management of Sepsis Among Previously Healthy Patients,"BACKGROUND: Most deaths resulting from sepsis occur among patients with advanced age, multiple morbidities, or frailty. It is unclear how many sepsis-related deaths truly are preventable. Previously healthy patients may provide insight into preventable sepsis mortality. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes associated with previously healthy patients with sepsis? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized for community-onset sepsis at 66 Michigan hospitals (November 2020-January 2024). We developed major and minor criteria to classify patients as previously healthy vs having significant comorbidities. We compared baseline characteristics, management, and outcomes of previously healthy patients vs patients with comorbid sepsis. Physicians reviewed charts of previously healthy patients with in-hospital death to evaluate baseline health status and rate preventability of death. RESULTS: Of 29,688 patients hospitalized for sepsis, 2,963 patients (10.0%) were classified as previously healthy. Previously healthy patients had median age of 53 years, a median of 2 minor comorbidities, and lower in-hospital mortality (5.8% vs 12.7%; P < .01) vs comorbid patients. Delivery of guideline-recommended early sepsis management ranged from 56.8% to 80.9% across individual care practices. Several care practices were less common among previously healthy patients, including lactate measurement (67.5% vs 73.8%; P < .01) and timely antibiotic administration (58.0% vs 66.3%; P < .01), whereas some were more common, including $ 30 mL/kg fluid resuscitation (72.4% vs 55.3%; P < .01). Among 48 charts of previously healthy decedents reviewed, 77.1% of patients were deemed to have life expectancy > 5 years without sepsis. Most deaths were judged to be unpreventable because of severity of illness on presentation. INTERPRETATION: We found that 1 in 10 patients with community-onset sepsis was healthy previously. Although gaps in in-hospital management were identified, deaths among previously healthy patients generally were deemed unpreventable with better in-hospital management because of patients seeking treatment too late in the course of sepsis.

The use of didactic materials specifically developed by the research team is effective in helping schoolchildren acquire emergency call skills.

This methodology enables schoolchildren to recognise emergency situations and initiate an EMS call, although some challenges remain in activating the hands-free function. These findings support the development of evidence-based recommendations for basic life support training in school settings.Abstract Background/Objectives: More than half of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests occur at home and are witnessed by family members, who must promptly call the Emergency Medical Services (EMS). The aim of this study was to assess the learning outcomes of an interactive school-based training activity focused specifically on the EMS call. Methods: A single-group, post-test-only simulation study was conducted in five Spanish schools. Participating schoolchildren received basic life support (BLS) training from their Physical Education teachers, integrated into the regular school schedule and following the Kids Save Lives recommendations. An innovative didactic resource (the ""BLS Endless Book"") was used to support active learning. Children's performance was evaluated in a simulated scenario using a standardized checklist. Results: A total of 1341 children aged 6 to 14 years participated. In the simulated scenario, more than 90% of participants were able to recognize the emergency and correctly identified and dialed the national emergency number. However, less than 50% were able to activate the hands-free function (with younger children experiencing more difficulty). During the call, 99.0% stated their full name, and 82.0% provided their complete address. Conclusions: A short, focused BLS training led at school by physical education teachers and based on an interactive, easy-to-use, didactic tool is effective in educating 6-14-year-old schoolchildren to correctly perform an immediate EMS call in case of cardiac arrest.

The primary objective of our study was to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality in neonates weighing less than 3 Kg and undergoing surgery with CPB. In addition, we compared the effect of early surgery with CPB (before 37W-gestational age (GA)) for congenital heart disease to delayed surgery until a corrected GA of 37 weeks in an attempt to promote weight gain. Methods: Retrospective single-center study including all patients operated between 1997 and 2017. Uni-and multivariable analysis were used to analyze outcome. Results: 143 patients were included. The median weight was 2.7 Kg and 49 (34.3%) weighted <2.5 Kg. 80% of the patients were Risk stratification STAT categories >= 3. 114 patients (80%) were operated without delay (usual timing, median age 9 days), whereas 29 patients (20%) entered a delayed strat-egy (median age 30 days). In-hospital mortality was 21.7%. By multivariate analysis, dysmaturity, preoperative positive ventilation, post-operative ECMO requirement or resuscitation, and any residual lesion were predictors of in-hospital death. In-hospital mortality in the usual timing group and the delayed group were 21.1% and 24.1%, respectively (p = 0.71). In-hospital mortality for neonates operated prior to 37W-GA (n = 10) was 27.3%.

Establishing prognostic patient profiles prior to the beginning of mental health care may facilitate higher efficacy of targeted interventions. The aim of the current study was to identify sociodemographic and somatic predictors of depression outcome among depressed patients with CAD.MethodsBased on the dataset of the multicentre SPIRR-CAD randomised controlled trial (n=570 patients with CAD and8 points on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), 141 potential sociodemographic and somatic predictors of the change in the HADS-D depression score from baseline to 18-month-follow-up were derived in two different ways. We screened for univariable association with response, using either analysis of (co)variance or logistic regression, respectively, both adjusted for baseline HADS-D value and treatment group. To guard against overfitting, multivariable association was evaluated by a linear or binomial (generalised) linear model with lasso regularisation, a machine learning approach. Outcome measures were the change in continuous HADS-D depression scores, as well as three established binary criteria. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was calculated to assess possible influences of comorbidities on our results and was also entered in our machine learning approach.ResultsHigher age (p=0.002), unknown previous myocardial infarction (p=0.013), and a higher heart rate variability during numeracy tests (p=.020) were univariably associated with a favourable depression outcome, whereas hyperuricemia (p0.003), higher triglycerides (p=0.014), NYHA class III (p0.028), state after resuscitation (p0.042), intake of thyroid hormones (p=0.007), antidiabetic drugs (p=0.015), analgesic drugs (p=0.027), beta blockers (p=0.035), uric acid drugs (p0.039), and anticholinergic drugs (p=0.045) were associated with an adverse effect on the HADS-D depression score. In all analyses, no significant differences between study arms could be found and physical comorbidities also had no significant influence on our results.ConclusionOur findings may contribute to identification of somatic and sociodemographic predictors of depression outcome in patients with CAD.

In recent years, the application of these advanced techniques and therapies in SCLC has also shown promise. This study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with surgery in selected limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC). Methods: In this retrospective, single-arm clinical trial, we conducted a thorough review of electronic medical records from the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between December 2015 and December 2022. Patients with a pathological diagnosis of SCLC who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery were enrolled. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, specifics of neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, survival outcomes, and safety profiles of included patients were systematically collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 47 patients [7 (14.89%) females and 40 (85.11%) males; median age 61.00 years, interquartile range (IQR), 55.50-67.50 years] were enrolled. The disease control rate was 100%, with an objective response rate of 70.21% and a downstaging rate of 65.9%. The percentage of patients with a complete pathological response (CPR) and major pathological response (MPR) was 10.64% (5/47) and 12.77% (6/47, excluding CPR), respectively. In subgroups stratified by baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, the MPR rate showed no significant differences, yet a trend toward higher MPR was observed among smoking patients. At the data cutoff (October 2, 2024), the median follow-up period was 35.367 months [IQR, 26.367 months-not reached (NR)]. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 16.27 months [95% confidence interval (CI): 12.20-30.53] and the median overall survival (OS) was NR, with 2-, 3-, and 4-year survival rates of 79.96% (95% CI: 68.36-93.52%), 71.39% (95% CI: 57.12-89.22%), and 64.90% (95% CI: 48.52-86.82%), respectively. The stratified analysis revealed that patients achieving an MPR and those undergoing postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy exhibited longer EFS and OS. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3-4 were observed in 21.28% of patients, with the most frequent occurrences being a decrease in neutrophil count (12.77%), followed by a decrease in platelet count (8.51%), and a decrease in white blood cell count (4.26%). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with surgery could be a potential treatment strategy for LS-SCLC, with a high proportion of patients achieving an MPR, and manageable safety profile, that did not compromise surgical resection.

Potential clinical applications and the available evidence are discussed in a separate paper. This review focuses on the practical aspects of cooling and physiological changes induced by hypothermia, as well as the potential side effects that may develop. These side effects can be serious and, if not properly dealt with, may negate some or all of hypothermia's potential benefits. However, many of these side effects can be prevented or modified by high-quality intensive care treatment, which should include careful monitoring of fluid balance, tight control of metabolic aspects such as glucose and electrolyte levels, prevention of infectious complications and various other interventions. The speed and duration of cooling and rate of re-warming are key factors in determining whether hypothermia will be effective; however, the risk of side effects also increases with longer duration. Realizing hypothermia's full therapeutic potential will therefore require meticulous attention to the prevention and/or early treatment of side effects, as well as a basic knowledge and understanding of the underlying physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms.

While emotional and physical stressors are common triggers, inflammatory or infectious stimuli have also been proposed, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In the context of critical illness, systemic inflammation may exacerbate cardiac dysfunction and contribute to multiorgan failure. Hemoadsorption has emerged as a promising adjunctive therapy option aimed at mitigating hyperinflammation by removing circulating cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, and has shown potential benefit in various inflammatory conditions.Case description A 77-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes, and a permanent pacemaker presented with acute dyspnea and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest. Post-resuscitation, she was found to have anterolateral ST elevations, apicomedial akinesis, and severely reduced LVEF (22%), consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, she developed worsening fever, marked hemodynamic instability, hyperlactatemia (14 mmol/L), atrial fibrillation, raising suspicion for a systemic hyperinflammatory response. Hemoadsorption therapy with CytoSorb was initiated in a stand-alone configuration, alongside corticosteroids and targeted temperature management. The patient showed marked improvement in hemodynamics, organ function, and urine output within 48 h, without the need for renal replacement therapy. She was later extubated and discharged home.Conclusion This case highlights a rare presentation of suspected inflammation-triggered Takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicated by rapid clinical deterioration. The use of CytoSorb hemoadsorption was associated with stabilization of vital parameters and recovery of organ function. Although causality cannot be confirmed, this case supports the early consideration of hemoadsorption as a feasible and potentially beneficial adjunct in select critically ill patients with suspected hyperinflammation. Further research is needed to clarify its role in TCM and related syndromes.",FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE,2025,"Castro, JO",10.3389/fmed.2025.1680632,,WOS:001587877100001,A

Identifying optimal resuscitation products for restoring plasma homeostasis following injury is important for improving management of these patients.Objectives:To determine the effects of crystalloid versus plasma resuscitation on thrombin generation in a rat model of trauma and hemorrhagic shock (HS).Patients/Methods:Rats were subjected to trauma and HS followed by resuscitation with Lactated Ringer's solution (LR) or fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Blood was collected at baseline, decompensation, and 3-h post-resuscitation. Thrombin generation was measured by calibrated automated thrombogram and antithrombin III (AT) by ELISA. In a prospective observational study, admission blood samples were collected on highest-level activation trauma patients and diluted with LR or FFP for thrombin generation analysis.Results:Resuscitation with LR resulted in persistent hypercoagulability; however, FFP resuscitation reversed this hypercoagulability to baseline thrombin generation or below. Plasma AT levels decreased following HS and remained low in rats receiving LR, but were corrected in rats receiving FFP. Similarly, in trauma patient plasma LR increased thrombin generation while FFP reduced it. However, results with AT-deficient plasma dilution were similar to LR. In patients with admission hypocoagulability, FFP slightly increased thrombin generation.Conclusions:HS in rats is associated with increased thrombin generation and resuscitation with FFP, not LR, reverses hypercoagulability. Dilution of trauma patient plasma with LR or FFP yielded similar results; however, the modulatory effects of FFP were attenuated when AT was absent. Importantly, FFP reduced thrombin generation in hypercoagulable patient plasma, but slightly increased thrombin generation in hypocoagulable patient plasma. Thus, FFP restores hemostatic balance following trauma and HS which is, in part, by delivering AT.",SHOCK,2016,"Cardenas, JC; Cap, AP; Swartz, MD; Huby, MD; Baer, LA; Matijevic, N; Cotton, BA; Holcomb, JB; Wade, CE",10.1097/SHK.0000000000000504,,WOS:000369988900009,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Absolute blood levels and kinetics of neurofilament light (NFL) chains for neurological prognosis in comatose patients after cardiac arrest,"Introduction Despite current guidelines, the prognosis of comatose patients after cardiac arrest (CA) remains indeterminate in approximately 50% of patients. Neurofilament light (NFL) chain, a biomarker of neuronal injury, appears to be a promising tool with better prognostic value compared to neuron-specific enolase (NSE). However, further studies are required. The objective was to evaluate the prognostic value of absolute blood levels and kinetics of NFL measured at 24, 48 and 72 h after CA to predict outcome. Methods A prospective study conducted at a tertiary CA center conducted between April 2023 and November 2024, including 67 comatose patients after CA with at least one blood NFL measurement. The primary outcome was neurological outcome according to the ""best"" modified Rankin scale (mRS) within 3 months, with a mRS 0-3 defining a good outcome. Results Participants were 64 years old (IQR [53-75]), and 67% were male. 60% of them had out-of-hospital CA and 42% had an initial shockable rhythm. NFL levels were significantly higher in patients with unfavorable outcome compared to those with favorable outcome at each time point (24 h: 256.0 [96.2-441.9] versus 37.9 [17.4-104.5] pg/mL, p < 0.001; 48 h: 1297.7 [137.6-3605.0] versus 36.4 [19.3-174.0] pg/mL, p < 0.001; 72 h: 1591.9 [350.6-4913.5] versus 49.3 [23.2-146.4] pg/mL, p < 0.001). NFL levels at 24 and 48 h showed moderate prognostic accuracy (AUC 0.80 and 0.88, respectively), while NFL at 72 h demonstrated high accuracy (AUC 0.90). For predicting poor outcome, NFL level at 24 h > 250 pg/mL had a specificity of 0.90 [0.75-0.90] and a sensitivity of 0.51 [0.35-0.67]. At 48 h, NFL > 383 pg/mL had a specificity of 0.94 [0.81-1.00] and a sensitivity of 0.66 [0.50-0.81]. At 72 h, NFL > 510 pg/mL presented a specificity of 1.00 [1.00-1.00] and a sensitivity of 0.74 [0.52-0.91]. To predict a good outcome, NFL levels < 82 pg/mL at 24 h, < 307 pg/mL at 48 h and < 459 pg/mL at 72 h after CA were the best compromise between specificity and sensitivity. NFL kinetic was not associated with neurological outcomes (AUC 0.50), whereas NSE kinetic measured between 24 and 72 h showed high prognostic accuracy (AUC 0.92). Conclusion In comatose patients after CA, NFL levels at 24, 48 and 72 h could predict both unfavorable and favorable outcomes. Conversely, only the kinetic of NSE levels between 24 and 72 h after CA was associated with neurological outcome.",ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE,2025,"Ayasse, T; Touron, M; Blanc, MC; Pruvost-Robieux, E; Lascarrou, JB; Vigneron, C; Mira, JP; Pène, F; Cariou, A; Benghanem, S",10.1186/s13613-025-01491-7,,WOS:001499630500001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Insight into the use of tympanic temperature during target temperature management in emergency and critical care: a scoping review,"Background Target temperature management (TTM) is suggested to reduce brain damage in the presence of global or local ischemia. Prompt TTM application may help to improve outcomes, but it is often hindered by technical problems, mainly related to the portability of cooling devices and temperature monitoring systems. Tympanic temperature (T-Ty) measurement may represent a practical, non-invasive approach for core temperature monitoring in emergency settings, but its accuracy under different TTM protocols is poorly characterized. The present scoping review aimed to collect the available evidence about T-Ty monitoring in TTM to describe the technique diffusion in various TTM contexts and its accuracy in comparison with other body sites under different cooling protocols and clinical conditions. Methods The scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR). PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched to identify studies conducted in the last 20 years, where T-Ty was measured in TTM context with specific focus on pre-hospital or in-hospital emergency settings. Results The systematic search identified 35 studies, 12 performing T-Ty measurements during TTM in healthy subjects, 17 in patients with acute cardiovascular events, and 6 in patients with acute neurological diseases. The studies showed that T-Ty was able to track temperature changes induced by either local or whole-body cooling approaches in both pre-hospital and in-hospital settings. Direct comparisons to other core temperature measurements from other body sites were available in 22 studies, which showed a faster and larger change of T-Ty upon TTM compared to other core temperature measurements. Direct brain temperature measurements were available only in 3 studies and showed a good correlation between T-Ty and brain temperature, although T-Ty displayed a tendency to overestimate cooling effects compared to brain temperature. Conclusions T-Ty was capable to track temperature changes under a variety of TTM protocols and clinical conditions in both pre-hospital and in-hospital settings. Due to the heterogeneity and paucity of comparative temperature data, future studies are needed to fully elucidate the advantages of T-Ty in emergency settings and its capability to track brain temperature.",JOURNAL OF INTENSIVE CARE,2021,"Masè, M; Micarelli, A; Falla, M; Regli, IB; Strapazzon, G",10.1186/s40560-021-00558-4,,WOS:000660781200001,A

A multimodal approach is currently used to diminish prognostic uncertainty.SummaryThe neurological examination remains the mainstay for prognosis after cardiac arrest. The combination electroencephalogram, somatosensory evoked potentials, and neuron-specific enolase improve prognostic accuracy, mostly in patients who underwent TTM.

This is the first study conducted to identify the factors affecting perinatal and neonatal deaths in Sao Tome & Principe (STP), the smallest Central Africa country. Methods Institution-based prospective cohort study conducted at Hospital Dr. Ayres Menezes. Maternal-neonate dyads enrolled were followed up after the 28th day of life (n = 194) for identification of neonatal death-outcome (n = 22) and alive-outcome groups (n = 172). Data were collected from pregnancy cards, hospital records and face-to-face interviews. After the 28th day of birth, a phone call was made to evaluate the newborn's health status. Crude odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were obtained. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The mean gestational age of the death-outcome and alive-outcome groups was 36 (SD = 4.8) and 39 (SD = 1.4) weeks, respectively. Death-outcome group (n = 22) included sixteen stillbirths, four early and two late neonatal deaths. High-risk pregnancy score [cOR 2.91, 95% CI: 1.18-7.22], meconium-stained fluid [cOR 4.38, 95% CI: 1.74-10.98], prolonged rupture of membranes [cOR 4.84, 95% CI: 1.47-15.93], transfer from another unit [cOR 6.08, 95% CI:1.95-18.90], and instrumental vaginal delivery [cOR 8.90, 95% CI: 1.68-47.21], were factors significantly associated with deaths. The odds of experiencing death were higher for newborns with infectious risk, IUGR, resuscitation maneuvers, fetal distress at birth, birth asphyxia, and unit care admission. Female newborn [cOR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.14-1.00] and birth weight of more than 2,500 g [cOR 0.017, 95% CI: 0.002-0.162] were found to be protective factors. Conclusion Factors such as having a high-risk pregnancy score, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, prolonged rupture of membranes, being transferred from another unit, and an instrumental-assisted vaginal delivery increased 4- to 9-fold the risk of stillbirth and neonatal deaths.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,"Barriers to and facilitators of rehabilitation according to socio-economic status, after acute respiratory distress syndrome due to COVID-19: A qualitative study in the RECOVIDS cohort","Background The COVID-19 pandemic may have compounded social disparities in access to healthcare, with possible deleterious consequences on the functional prognosis of patients after a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). In the previous RECOVIDS study, we reported that despite comparable pulmonary sequelae and similar access to rehabilitation, socio-economically ""vulnerable"" patients had lower quality of life at 6 months after an ICU stay. We aimed to describe the barriers to, and facilitators of participation in rehabilitation, among patients from the RECOVIDS study, regardless of their socio-economic situation.Methods Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with adult patients admitted to ICU for PCR-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection, and who had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or had received high flow nasal oxygen. In addition, patients had to have been living at home for the month prior to the interview and had to be proficient in French. Eligible patients were randomly selected, aiming to select the same number of socially deprived and non-socially-deprived patients. Interviews were transcribed for thematic analysis.Results In total, 31 interviews were performed from 10/2021 to 01/2022; 16 with socially deprived, and 15 with non-deprived participants. Average age was 65.2 (+/- 11.6) years. Four themes emerged from the analysis of the interviews, namely: (1) the impact of the patient's professional and socio-economic situation; (2) the feeling that age and socio-economic situation influence access to rehabilitation; (3) a perception that the healthcare system was saturated, and that inequalities exist in access to rehabilitation resources; (4) perception of previous own health and expectations of post-resuscitation health status.Conclusion A precarious socio-economic situation has a substantial impact on access to rehabilitation after ICU admission for ARDS caused by COVID-19. It represents a barrier to rehabilitation through the combined action of various social determinants that deserve to be detected early, in order to take appropriate action to ensure that the most socially vulnerable individuals can benefit from access to rehabilitation.",PLOS ONE,2025,"Kléber, M; Meunier-Beillard, N; Fournel, I; Ksiazek, E; Jacquier, M; Ecarnot, F; Rigaud, JP; Declerq, PL; Quenot, JP; Labruyère, M",10.1371/journal.pone.0316318,,WOS:001435429100028,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY IN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION,"Thrombolytic therapy has revolutionized the treatment of acute myocardial infarction by reducing mortality and preserving left ventricular function. It is relatively safe and cost-effective. However, it is currently underused in most countries. Patients in whom thrombolysis is indicated include those with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram or bundle branch block pattern who present within 12 hours of myocardial infarction; the indications should be widened to include the elderly, patients who have undergone nontraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and women during menstruation. The risk-benefit ratio should be assessed for the individual patient. Prehospital thrombolytic treatment has been shown to be feasible with the support of well-trained staff and resuscitation equipment, and may be cost-effective in communities with time delays before hospitalization greater than 1 hour. The most important strategy is to shorten the ''door to needle'' time in hospital. The importance of full infarct-related artery flow (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] grade 3 flow) for preservation of ventricular function and survival has been documented in the second Thrombolysis Trial of Eminase in Acute Myocardial infarction (TEAM 2) and the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) studies. Aspirin and heparin are beneficial adjunctive regimens to thrombolytic therapy but optimal epicardial reperfusion is achieved in only about half of patients. Improved thrombolytic, adjunctive antiplatelet, and antithrombotic regimens are required to achieve early full reperfusion, which is crucial to improve survival and quality of life.",CURRENT OPINION IN CARDIOLOGY,1994,"WOO, KS; WHITE, HD",,,WOS:A1994NX68300010,A

With impending physician-assisted death legislation there is an urgency to find more efficient and beneficial ways for clinicians and patients to address resuscitation issues at the bedside. Paradigmatic shifts in the nature of the patient-physician relationship will need to be encouraged by the larger community. These encouraged shifts address the concepts of passive/inferior patient - active/superior physician, patient ownership of and access to all their health care information, and treating the patient as a major participant in the delivery of health care. These recommended changes will not in themselves make any patient, physician or other healthcare provider more humane and open in the patient's final days.

However, these assumptions are supported by observational studies. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials aims to compare the impact of lower versus higher blood pressure targets on mortality. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Scholar from inception to February 10, 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials comparing lower versus higher blood pressure targets in the management of critically ill and perioperative settings. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up available. This review was registered in the Prospective International Register of Systematic Reviews, CRD42023452928. DATA SYNTHESIS: f 2940 studies identified by the search string, 28 (12 in critically ill and 16 in perioperative settings) were included totaling 15,672 patients. Patients in the low blood pressure target group had lower mortality (23 studies included: 1019/7679 [13.3%] vs. 1103/7649 [14.4%]; relative risk 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99; p = 0.03; I-2 = 0%). This corresponded to a 97.4% probability of any increase in mortality with a Bayesian approach. These findings were mainly driven by studies performed in the ICU setting and with treatment lasting more than 24 hours; however, the magnitude and direction of the results were similar in the majority of sensitivity analyses including the analysis restricted to low risk of bias studies. We also observed a lower rate of atrial fibrillation and fewer patients requiring transfusion in low-pressure target groups. No differences were found in the other secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on pooled randomized trial evidence, a lower compared with a higher blood pressure target results in a reduction of mortality, atrial fibrillation, and transfusion requirements. Lower blood pressure targets may be beneficial but there is ongoing uncertainty. However, the present meta-analysis does not confirm previous findings and recommendations.

After ICD therapy, 50% of survivors ore known to have significantly elevated anxiety, depression, anger, and fear in getting back to normal physical activities. Despite these problems, few interventions to improve adjustment have been rigorously evaluated within a clinical trial format. This article reports the short-term efficacy of a structured weekly educational telephone intervention (8 weeks) delivered by expert cardiovascular nurses to recipients of an ICD. To test these effects, a two-group (n = 84/group) randomized clinical trial design was used with measures at baseline (hospital discharge), 1 month, and 3 months after ICD therapy. The study sample were first time ICD recipients for secondary prevention of sudden cardiac arrest.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Transcatheter based electromechanical mapping guided intramyocardial transplantation and in vivo tracking of human stem cell based three dimensional microtissues in the porcine heart,"Stem cells have been repeatedly suggested for cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the low retention rate of single cell suspensions limits the efficacy of current therapy concepts so far. Taking advantage of three dimensional (3D) cellular self-assembly prior to transplantation may be beneficial to overcome these limitations. In this pilot study we investigate the principal feasibility of intramyocardial delivery of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D microtissues (3D-MTs) in a porcine model. 3D-MTs were generated from iron-oxide (MPIO) labeled human adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (ATMSCs) using a modified hanging-drop method. Nine pigs (33 +/- 2 kg) comprising seven healthy ones and two with chronic MI in the left ventricle (LV) anterior wall were included. The pigs underwent intramyocardial transplantation of 16 x 10(3) 3D-MTs (1250 cells/MT; accounting for 2 x 10(7) single ATMSCs) into the anterior wall of the healthy pigs (n = 7)/the MI border zone of the infarcted (n = 2) of the LV using a 3D NOGA electromechanical mapping guided, transcatheter based approach. Clinical follow-up (FU) was performed for up to five weeks and in-vivo cell-tracking was performed using serial magnet resonance imaging (MRI). Thereafter, the hearts were harvested and assessed by PCR and immunohistochemistry. Intramyocardial transplantation of human ATMSC based 3D-MTs was successful in eight animals (88.8%) while one pig (without MI) died during the electromechanical mapping due to sudden cardiac-arrest. During RI, no arrhythmogenic, embolic or neurological events occurred in the treated pigs. Serial MRI confirmed the intramyocardial presence of the 3D-MTs by detection of the intracellular iron-oxide MPIOs during FU. Intramyocardial retention of 3D-MTs was confirmed by PCR analysis and was further verified on histology and immunohistochemical analysis. The 3D-MTs appeared to be viable, integrated and showed an intact micro architecture. We demonstrate the principal feasibility and safety of intramyocardial transplantation of in-vitro generated stem cell-based 3D-MTs. Multimodal cell-tracking strategies comprising advanced imaging and in-vitro tools allow for in-vivo monitoring and post-mortem analysis of transplanted 3D-MTs. The concept of 3D cellular self-assembly represents a promising application format as a next generation technology for cell-based myocardial regeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Obstetric Life Support (OBLS) is a validated simulation-based curriculum designed to equip prehospital and hospital-based healthcare workers (HCWs) with the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent, recognize, and manage maternal medical emergencies. Widespread implementation of OBLS could enhance patient safety and reduce disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality. However, research is needed to develop strategies that ensure sustained and equitable access for HCWs across diverse healthcare settings. This paper presents a protocol for evaluating a train-the-trainer approach to implement OBLS in hospitals, freestanding birthing centers, and prehospital contexts across Arizona.MethodsThis multisite, mixed-methods study is being conducted in collaboration with the Arizona Perinatal Trust, a regional perinatal health system that encompasses 38 in-hospital birthing centers and Level I-IV hospitals across Arizona, and the Arizona Emergency Medical Systems LLC, which coordinates 85 emergency medical services agencies statewide. A Steering Committee comprising local, regional, and national stakeholders provides guidance and oversight for all study activities. To promote rapid learning, two consecutive OBLS implementation and evaluation cycles will be conducted, with the second cycle incorporating feedback and lessons learned from the first. HCWs from 16 implementation sites (8 per cycle) serving areas with high maternal vulnerability indexes will be trained as OBLS instructors. These instructors will train at least 160 HCWs (80 per cycle) within their respective or nearby institutions. Outcomes to be assessed include reach (proportion and representation of institutions offering OBLS, instructors trained, and HCWs participating), effectiveness (impact of OBLS on knowledge and clinical competencies, presence of code carts containing OBLS cognitive aids and resuscitative cesarean delivery kits in hospitals, and the use of an OB Arrest Alert in prehospital settings), adoption (allocation of resources for OBLS), implementation (number of courses completed, fidelity of the training delivery), and maintenance (extent to which training becomes integrated into routine practice and policy).DiscussionFindings from this statewide study will be used to promote the scale-up and sustainability of OBLS, ultimately enhancing maternal healthcare quality and equity.",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2025,"Cunningham, SD; Carandang, RR; Wood, LS; Barry, M; Baker, P; Murphy, M; Roth, CK; Becker, LR; Thomson, B; Mosesso, V; Vidosh, J; Phelps, J; Sutton, B; Grady, JJ; Annis-Brayne, K; Shields, A",10.1186/s12913-025-12739-0,,WOS:001489453900003,A

Previous studies have reported higher ticagrelor exposure in Asian patients than in Caucasians. This prompted us to investigate the correlation between ticagrelor concentrations and bleeding events. Methods Patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome and receiving dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and ticagrelor) were enrolled and followed up for 12 months. Trough plasma concentrations of ticagrelor and a major active metabolite were assayed, and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with ticagrelor pharmacokinetics and safety were also identified. Results A total of 631 patients were included and 133 patients had bleeding academic research consortium type 1 or 2 bleeding event. The median ticagrelor concentration (interquartile range) was significantly higher in patients with bleeding events than that in patients without bleeding events (322.6 ng/mL [196.2-458.0 ng/mL] vs. 222.1 ng/mL [140.4-341.9 ng/mL], P < .001).

We conducted a study to evaluate how often paramedic students performed these procedures during their training. Methods 71 students were asked how often they had performed 17 procedures during their training. We compared the results with the recommended number of procedures that the German board of EMS medical directors promoted. Results are displayed as mean (standard deviation). Statistical analysis was performed with SOFA (Paton-Simpson and Associates Ltd, USA). Results Face-mask ventilation was performed in-hospital 124.9 (73.9), prehospital 6.2 (13.4) and in paramedic school 115.2 (89.1) times. An extraglottic airway was performed in-hospital 58.6 (49.7), prehospital 2.7 (4.0) and in paramedic school 93.5 (66.3) times. Intubation (direct laryngoscopy) was performed in-hospital 31.3 (32.8), prehospital 0.3 (1.3) and in paramedic school 14.9 (15.1) times. Non-invasive ventilation was performed in-hospital 4.9 (8.7), prehospital 1.8 (2.6) and in paramedic school 3.2 (4.5) times. Intravenous cannulation was performed in-hospital 165.8 (116.0) and prehospital 145.2 (162.8) times. An intraosseous access was performed in-hospital 0.1 (0.3), prehospital 0.4 (0.7) and in paramedic school 5.8 (6.4) times. Needle thoracostomy was performed in-hospital 0.1 (0.3), prehospital 0.01 (0.1) and in paramedic school 8.9 (8.9) times. Defibrillation was performed in-hospital 1.7 (3.4), prehospital 9.1 (11.9) and in paramedic school 172.0 (129.2) times. Cardioversion was performed in-hospital 1.5 (3.5), prehospital 0.2 (0.6) and in paramedic school 14.4 (58.9) times.

Community consultation included flyers, radio announcements, newspaper advertisements, mailings, and in-person surveys at basketball games and ED waiting rooms. The PROTECT trial (2021-present) randomizes OOHCA survivors to prophylactic ceftriaxone or placebo; the community consultation plan during the pandemic included city council presentations, social media posts, outpatient flyers, but no in-person encounters. Demographics for PRO-TECT community consultation were compared to PEARL and INTCAR registry data, with p-value < 0.05 considered significant.Results: PEARL surveyed 1,362 adults, including 64 % >= 60 years old, 96 % high school graduates or beyond; research acceptance rate was 92 % for the community and 76 % for personal level.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Comparison of In-Hospital Mortality and Neurosurgical Intervention Between Intracranial Gunshot Wounds Arising From Long Guns and Handguns: A Propensity Score Matched Study,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with intracranial gunshot wounds (IC-GSWs) often present with severe neurological injuries requiring prompt neurological evaluation. Neurosurgical intervention is reserved for those with reasonable chances of survival. Handguns and long guns, such as shotguns and rifles, have differing mechanisms of injury which may influence surgical candidacy and outcomes. This study aims to compare rates and types of neurosurgical intervention and inpatient outcomes in patients with IC-GSWs handguns and long guns. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was retrospectively queried for patients with IC-GSWs from 2017 to 2019. Patients with long gun IC-GSWs were propensity score matched with those with handgun IC-GSWs based on patient demographics, comorbidities, insurance status, injury extent and severity, and hospital trauma level. Group differences were compared using Student's t-tests and Pearson's chi(2) tests, and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, patients in the long gun group were more likely to undergo neurosurgical intervention (21% vs 17%, P = .02). Following propensity score matching, the long gun group had lower rates of in-hospital mortality (35% vs 43%, P < .01), lower rates of cardiac arrest (5% vs 8%, P = .02), and lower rates of reoperation (0% vs 2%, P = .02) than the handgun group. In multivariable regression, independent predictors of survival included long gun IC-GSWs (odds ratio [OR] 0.65, CI 0.52-0.83), neurosurgical foreign body removal (OR 0.44, CI 0.33-0.58), intracranial debridement (OR 0.47, 0.33-0.67), and craniectomy (OR 0.46, CI 0.34-0.63). CONCLUSION: Patients with IC-GSWs present to the hospital with severe neurological injury. Neurosurgical intervention was independently associated with decreased mortality. After matching, patients with long gun IC-GSWs experienced lower in-hospital mortality rates compared with those from handguns. This study suggests that patients suffering from long gun IC-GSW may respond particularly well to neurosurgical intervention and firearm type should be considered when determining neurosurgical candidacy.",NEUROSURGERY,2024,"Jiang, SH; Marotta, D; Neves, TM; Bhaskara, M; Mehta, AI",10.1227/neu.0000000000002937,,WOS:001314535300003,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Treatment with dipyridamole improves cardiac function and prevent injury in a rat model of hemorrhage,"Hemorrhagic shock is a leading cause of death despite the improvement in emergency services. One reason is that the resuscitation policies are designed to reestablish tissue perfusion, but not to prevent the inflammatory response to shock that cause myocardial dysfunction and injury. Dipyridamole is a platelet inhibitor that promotes anti-inflammatory effects. The present study investigated the therapeutic value of treatment with dipyridamole before resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock on myocardial injury and protection. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 3 experimental groups (n=6 per group): 1) hemorrhage, 2) hemorrhage treated with dipyridamole, and 3) sham hemorrhage. Rats were hemorrhaged over 60 min to reach a mean arterial blood pressure of 40 mm Hg. After 60 min hemorrhagic shock, rats were treated or not by injection of 1 mL of (20 mu g/L) dipyridamole intra-arterially. Resuscitation was made in vivo by reinfusion of the shed blood to restore norm tension for 30 min. Arterial blood samples were collected for measurements of TNF-alpha. Left ventricular generated pressure and + dP/dtmax was significantly higher in dipyridamole treated rats compared to the untreated group. Myocardial biopsy samples were taken for light and electron microscopy. Dipyridamole decreased the number of inflammatory cells and mitochondrial swollen.

It typically results from large-volume fluid infusions during acute resuscitation and is worsened by hypoalbuminemia. Recognized as edema, fluid retention is important for its association with delayed weaning and increased mortality. The standard treatment is the administration of diuretics, with or without albumin. We hypothesize that intravenous 25% albumin plus furosemide, by comparison with furosemide alone, improves diuresis, oxygenation, and hemodynamic stability in the deresuscitation of critically ill, hypoalbuminemic patients.

The Utstein Templates recommend the use of the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (GP-CPC) to divide patients according to their neurological outcome. However, several studies investigating biochemical markers and SSEP are based on the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS). We noticed that many studies failed to exclude patients who died without certified brain damage from patients classified as poor outcome, instead including all patients who died into this category. Therefore, we summarized the published NSE cut-off values and the derived sensitivity and specificity to predict poor outcome of those studies which only included patients with certified brain death in GOS-1 or GP-CPC-5 (group A) vs. those studies which did not differentiate between death from any cause or death due to primary brain damage (group B). On average, mean NSE cut-off values and sensitivity were higher (56 +/- 35 ng/ml, 56 +/- 18%) in group A than in group B (41 +/- 17 ng/ml, 44 +/- 25%), respectively. The specificity remained equally high in both groups. In analogy, the average sensitivity of SSEP to predict poor outcome was higher in group A (76 +/- 11%) than in group B (50 +/- 15%), while the specificity was similar in both groups. Conclusively, inclusion of deaths without certified brain damage after CA in neurological outcome studies will lead to underestimation of the prognostic power of biochemical or electrophysiological markers for brain damage. A modified GOS and GP-CPC score might help to avoid this bias. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Bench-to-bedside review: Brain dysfunction in critically ill patients - the intensive care unit and beyond,"Critical care physicians often find themselves prognosticating for their patients, attempting to predict patient survival as well as disability. In the case of neurologic injury, this can be especially difficult. A frequent cause of coma in the intensive care unit is resuscitation following cardiac arrest, for which mortality and severe neurologic disability remain high. Recent studies of the clinical examination, of serum markers such as neuron-specific enolase, and of somatosensory evoked potentials allow accurate and specific prediction of which comatose patients are likely to suffer a poor outcome. Using these tools, practitioners can confidently educate the family for the majority of patients who will die or remain comatose at 1 month. Delirium is a less dramatic form of neurologic injury but, when sought, is strikingly prevalent. In addition, delirium in the intensive care unit is associated with increased mortality and poorer functional recovery, prompting investigation into preventative and therapeutic strategies to counter delirium. Finally, neurologic damage may persist long after the patient's recovery from critical illness, as is the case for cognitive dysfunction detected months and years after critical illness. Psychiatric impairment including depression or post-traumatic stress disorder may also arise.

We present two clinical cases of cat-TS treated in our department. Case summary Case one: 78-year-old man, admitted to Ear Nose and Throat Unit for surgical removal of oral squamous cellular carcinoma. During surgery, the occurrence of hypotensive episode was treated with catecholamines. After surgery, the occurrence of atrial fibrillation was followed by evidence of phasic increase of troponin levels and akinesia of midventricular segments. Angiography showed the absence of significant coronary stenoses, and during hospital stay, we observed rapid recovery of wall motion abnormalities. Case two: 64-year-old woman, admitted for hysteropexy surgery, during which cardiac arrest occurred, treated with epinephrine i.v.1 mg and DC shock. Two hours after resuscitation, the patient developed pulmonary oedema, troponin levels increased progressively, and the echocardiogram demonstrated hypokinesia in all midventricular segments with apical sparing. Afterwards, an urgent angiography highlighted normal coronary anatomy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed oedema corresponding to hypokinetic areas. On the seventh day, echocardiogram showed a complete remission of wall motion abnormalities. Discussion These cases warn the physicians about the importance of routinely screening myocardial impairment through clinical assessment, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, and serial cardiac troponin testing after catecholamine i.v. bolus administration.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,A Systematic Literature Review of Artificial Intelligence in Prehospital Emergency Care,"Background: The emergency medical services (EMS) sector, as a complex system, presents substantial hurdles in providing excellent treatment while operating within limited resources, prompting greater adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for improving operational efficiency. While AI models have proved beneficial in healthcare operations, there is limited explainability and interpretability, as well as a lack of data used in their application and technological advancement. Methods: The scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews, using PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science, with a procedure of double screening and extraction. The search included articles published from 2018 to the beginning of 2025. Studies were excluded if they did not explicitly identify an artificial intelligence (AI) component, lacked relevance to emergency department (ED) or prehospital contexts, failed to report measurable outcomes or evaluations, or did not exploit real-world data. We analyzed the data source used, clinical subclasses, AI domains, ML algorithms, their performance, as well as potential roles for large language models (LLMs) in future applications. Results: A comprehensive PRISMA-guided methodology was used to search academic databases, finding 1181 papers on prehospital emergency treatment from 2018 to 2025, with 65 articles identified after an extensive screening procedure. The results reveal a significant increase in AI publications. A notable technological advancement in the application of AI in EMS using different types of data was explored. Conclusions: These findings highlighted that AI and ML have emerged as revolutionary innovations with huge potential in the fields of healthcare and medicine. There are several promising AI interventions that can improve prehospital emergency care, particularly for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and triage prioritization scenarios. Implications for EMS Practice: Integrating AI methods into prehospital care can optimize the use of available resources, as well as triage and dispatch efficiency. LLMs may have the potential to improve understanding and assist in decision-making under pressure in emergency situations by combining various forms of recorded data. However, there is a need to emphasize continued research and strong collaboration between AI experts and EMS physicians to ensure the safe, ethical, and effective integration of AI into EMS practice.",BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING,2025,"Elfahim, O; Edjinedja, KL; Cossus, J; Youssfi, M; Barakat, O; Desmettre, T",10.3390/bdcc9090219,,WOS:001580284500001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,A review of early warning systems for prompt detection of patients at risk for clinical decline,"Early Warning Scores (EWS) are a composite evaluation of a patient's basic physiology, changes of which are the first indicators of clinical decline and are used to prompt further patient assessment and when indicated intervention. These are sometimes referred to as ""track and triggers systems"" with tracking meant to denote periodic observation of physiology and trigger being a predetermined response criteria. This review article examines the most widely used EWS, with special attention paid to those used in military and trauma populations. The earliest EWS is the Modified Early Earning Score (MEWS). In MEWS, points are allocated to vital signs based on their degree of abnormality, and summed to yield an aggregate score. A score above a threshold would elicit a clinical response such as a rapid response team. Modified Early Earning Score was subsequently followed up with the United Kingdom's National Early Warning Score, the electronic cardiac arrest triage score, and the 10 Signs of Vitality score, among others. Severity of illness indicators have been in military and civilian trauma populations, such as the Revised Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, and Trauma and Injury Severity. The sequential organ failure assessment score and its attenuated version quick sequential organ failure assessment were developed to aggressively identify patients near septic shock. Effective EWS have certain characteristics. First, they should accurately capture vital signs information. Second, almost all data should be derived electronically rather than manually. Third, the measurements should take into consideration multiple organ systems. Finally, information that goes into an EWS must be captured in a timely manner. Future trends include the use of machine learning to detect subtle changes in physiology and the inclusion of data from biomarkers. As EWS improve, they will be more broadly used in both military and civilian environments.",JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY,2019,"Kramer, AA; Sebat, F; Lissauer, M",10.1097/TA.0000000000002197,,WOS:000506576600012,A

The previously healthy 38 years old male driver veered off the motorway and collided with a tree. The ambulance arrived at the scene 9 min after being called by an eyewitness and, following rapid extrication from the wreckage; the patient arrived in hospital 27 min later (with a GCS of 6). and was immediately intubated. The patient had suffered near-complete amputation of the left leg at upper femoral shaft level. along with multiple distal fractures and open wounds. He also sustained a head injury and closed displaced fractures of left radius and ulna. The patient received 21 of crystalloids in the pre-hospital phase, Once in hospital the haemorrhage was controlled with a pressure dressing and intra-venous fluids were kept to a minimum until he was taken promptly to theatre. His initial arterial blood sample revealed a pH of 6.57, pCo(2) of 9.18 kPa, apO(2) of 70.11 kPa and a base excess of -27.5 mmol l(-1). The co-oximeter Hb was 5.8 g dl(-1). Haemorrhage was controlled in theatre where he was transfused a total of 30 U of blood, 1 pack of platelets, 12 U of fresh frozen plasma, 3.5 1 of crystalloids and 1.5 1 of colloid. Sodium bicarbonate was administered three times. He subsequently remained ventilated in intensive care unit (ICU). Over the following week he survived sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and myoglobinuria (with transient renal failure) attributable to rhabdomyolysis secondary to muscle necrosis. He later underwent diversion colostomy and disarticulating amputation of the left femur after several debridements. After 6 weeks on ICU he made an excellent recovery will full return of his mental abilities, In this case, the serial arterial blood samples obtained were reliable. The lactic acidosis observed was the result of profound tissue hypo-perfusion and its rate of clearance seems to have greater prognostic value than its peak or initial value. Several factors may have contributed to the patient's survival: rapid retrieval from the scene, early intubation with excellent subsequent oxygenation (thus avoiding the dangerous combination of hypoxia and acidosis with synergistic influence on cardiac depression) and limited initial fluid resuscitation in the emergency department with prompt surgical intervention and vigorous restoration of organ perfusion after surgical haemostasis. Immediate operative haemostasis, coupled with restricted fluid administration beforehand and vigorous restoration of organ perfusion afterwards is now replacing the old resuscitation paradigm. Perhaps this shift in practice has helped this patient to survive.

Standard treatment involves immunosuppressive therapy, which is associated with adverse events and mortality in the frail population of patients with acquired haemophilia A. This study investigated whether emicizumab, a factor VIIIa mimetic antibody, protects patients with acquired haemophilia A from bleeding and allows deferral of immunosuppression during the first 12 weeks after diagnosis. Methods We report final results of an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial. Adult patients with acquired haemophilia A from 16 haemophilia treatment centres in Germany and Austria were eligible if they had not previously received immunosuppression. Patients received emicizumab subcutaneously (6 and 3 mg/kg on days 1 and 2, 1 center dot 5 mg/kg weekly until week 12), but no immunosuppression. Follow-up was until week 24. The primary endpoint was the number of clinically relevant bleeds per patient-week until week 12. Emicizumab was considered effective if the mean bleeding rate was significantly below 0 center dot 15 bleeds per patient-week, the rate observed in a previous study of patients with acquired haemophilia A treated with bypassing agents and immunosuppression but no emicizumab. The study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04188639 and is complete. Findings Of 49 patients screened from March 25, 2021, to June 10, 2022, 47 were enrolled (23 women, 24 men). Median age was 76 years (IQR 66-80), 46 (98%) of 47 patients were White, median factor VIII activity was 1 center dot 4 IU/dL (0 center dot 3-5 center dot 6), and median inhibitor concentration was 11 center dot 4 Bethesda units per mL (3 center dot 9-42 center dot 7). Mean breakthrough bleeding rate was 0 center dot 04 bleeds per patient-week (upper 97 center dot 5% CI 0 center dot 06). 33 (70%) of 47 patients had no bleeding events, seven patients (15%) had one bleed, six patients (13%) had two bleeds, and one patient (2%) had three bleeds. Adverse events of grade 3 or worse included COVID-19 (n=2), acute kidney injury (n=2), and stroke (n=1). Four of 47 patients died, including two deaths related to bleeding, one from COVID-19, and one from cardiac arrest (none were judged as related to emicizumab). Interpretation This study suggests that emicizumab prophylaxis prevents bleeding in patients with acquired haemophilia A and that immunosuppressive therapy can be deferred while patients are receiving this treatment. The low number of thromboembolic events, severe infections, and fatalities observed in this study are promising.

The authors sought to determine whether internal electroencephalogram (EEG) subparameters extracted by the BIS monitor (Medtronic, USA), a device commonly used to estimate depth of anesthesia intraoperatively, could be repurposed to predict recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest.Methods:In this retrospective cohort study, a three-layer neural network was trained to predict recovery of consciousness to the point of command following versus not based on 48 h of continuous EEG recordings in 315 comatose patients admitted to a single U.S. academic medical center after cardiac arrest (derivation cohort, n = 181; validation cohort, n = 134). Continuous EEGs were partially processed into subparameters using virtualized emulation of the BIS Engine (i.e., the internal software of the BIS monitor) applied to signals from the frontotemporal leads of the standard 10-20 EEG montage. The model was trained on hourly averaged measurements of these internal subparameters. This model's performance was compared to the modified Westhall qualitative EEG scoring framework.Results:Maximum prognostic accuracy in the derivation cohort was achieved using a network trained on only four BIS subparameters (inverse burst suppression ratio, mean spectral power density, gamma power, and theta/delta power). In a held-out sample of 134 patients, the model outperformed current state-of-the-art qualitative EEG assessment techniques at predicting recovery of consciousness (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.86; accuracy, 0.87; sensitivity, 0.83; specificity, 0.88; positive predictive value, 0.71; negative predictive value, 0.94). Gamma band power has not been previously reported as a correlate of recovery potential after cardiac arrest.Conclusions:In patients comatose after cardiac arrest, four EEG features calculated internally by the BIS Engine were repurposed by a compact neural network to achieve a prognostic accuracy superior to the current clinical qualitative accepted standard, with high sensitivity for recovery.

In this paper, the authors review the underlying pathophysiology of trauma-related hemorrhagic shock, specifically the factors which contribute to the development of the acute coagulopathy of trauma shock (ACoTS). We then review the best available evidence for treatment strategies in the pre-hospital setting, as well as the in-hospital setting. Interventions that are strongly supported in the literature include utilization of a well-organized trauma system with direct transport to a designated trauma centre, the early use of tranexamic acid, and damage control orthopaedic surgical techniques and resuscitation protocols. Targeted resuscitation is an evolving field, with use of thromboelastography to guide resuscitation being a particularly promising area. Special trauma populations at particularly high risk are also reviewed, including the geriatric population, as well as unstable pelvic fractures, which are each at increased risk for poor outcomes, and deserve special attention. Major advances have been made in this important area, and ongoing research into the understanding and correction of ACoTS will continue to guide practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Although WB in children has been shown to be feasible, its effectiveness has yet to be explored. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of WB transfusion as an adjunct to component therapy (CT) compared with CT only as early resuscitation for pediatric trauma patients. METHODS Children aged 1 to 17 years, who were transfused within 4 hours of presentation, were identified in the Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2017 database. Patients were stratified into those receiving WB-CT versus CT alone. Propensity score matching in a 1:2 ratio was performed based on patient demographics, injury characteristics, hemorrhage control interventions, and trauma center level. The primary outcome measure was patient transfusion requirement. Secondary outcome measures were mortality, hospital length of stay, ventilation days, and major complications. RESULTS A total of 135 children receiving WB-CT were matched to 270 patients receiving CT only. Mean (SD) age was 12 (5) years, 66% were male, and the median Injury Severity Score was 32 (range, 20-43). A total of 51% of patients were in shock, 34% had penetrating injuries, and 41% required surgical intervention for hemorrhage control. Total blood products transfused were significantly decreased in children receiving WB, both at 4 hours (35 [22-73] vs. 48 [33-95] mL/kg; p = 0.013) and 24 hours (39 [24-97] vs. 53 [36-119] mL/kg; p < 0.001). Mortality rate at 24 hours (19.3% vs. 21.9%; p = 0.546) and in-hospital mortality (31.1% vs. 34.4%; p = 0.502) were not different. Similarly, no difference in hospital length of stay and rates of major complications was found. Patients in the WB group required significantly less ventilation days (2 [2-6] vs. 3 [2-8] days; p = 0.021).

As the risk factors of CVD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are most mentioned. Early stage hypertension in the population with dyslipidemia is an important public health hazard. This study was the application of data-driven machine learning (ML), demonstrating complex relationships between risk factors and outcomes and promising predictive performance with vast amounts of medical data, aimed to investigate the association between dyslipidemia and the incidence of early stage hypertension in a large cohort with normal blood pressure at baseline. Methods: This study analyzed annual health screening data for 71,108 people from 2005 to 2017, including data for 27 risk-related indicators, sourced from the MJ Group, a major health screening center in Taiwan. We used five machine learning (ML) methods-stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (Lasso), ridge regression (Ridge), and gradient boosting with categorical features support (CatBoost)-to develop a multi-stage ML algorithm-based prediction scheme and then evaluate important risk factors at the early stage of hypertension, especially for groups with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels within or out of the reference range. Results: Age, body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting plasma glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were associated with hypertension. The hemoglobin level was also a positive contributor to blood pressure elevation and it appeared among the top three important risk factors in all LDL-C/HDL-C groups; therefore, these variables may be important in affecting blood pressure in the early stage of hypertension. A residual contribution to blood pressure elevation was found in groups with increased LDL-C. This suggests that LDL-C levels are associated with CPR levels, and that the LDL-C level may be an important factor for predicting the development of hypertension. Conclusion: The five prediction models provided similar classifications of risk factors. The results of this study show that an increase in LDL-C is more important than the start of a drop in HDL-C in health screening of sub-healthy adults. The findings of this study should be of value to health awareness raising about hypertension and further discussion and follow-up research.",DIAGNOSTICS,2022,"Liao, PC; Chen, MS; Jhou, MJ; Chen, TC; Yang, CT; Lu, CJ",10.3390/diagnostics12081965,,WOS:000846175900001,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,CPAPER,Understanding First-Aid Learning Intention Through Using Social Media: Perceptions from External Emergency Events and Individual Internal Changes,"Emergency events, such as out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, are China's leading causes of mortality. However, witnesses of emergencies are seldom trained with first-aid measures before emergency events happens. Relative to traditional offline first-aid training methods, social media greatly enhanced audiences' interest in first-aid learning in a more entertaining, time-saving, and labor-saving way. Based on Construal Level Theory (CLT), this study aims to understand the impact of external emergencies (past emergencies experience) on individual internal change (psychological distances) and subsequently generate first-aid learning intention through using social media. As emergencies are severe but not widespread, this study only examines social and spatial dimensions of psychological distance (PD) to broaden the application scenarios of CLT. At the same time, we apply prosociality to measure the individual difference. This study conducts a survey in a first-aid popularization account on Sina Weibo. 348 participants, who had never learned first-aid knowledge and skills before, engaged. Results prove that both PDs and prosociality may be impacted by external emergency experiences, then promote related learning intention. This study also finds that prosociality moderates the relationship between spatial distance and related learning intention. This study roots in an emergency context and broadens the application of CLT in first-aid learning. At the same time, since first-aid training is usually hard to grasp and residents usually do not need complex skills to rescue people in emergency events, we applied social media as our learning context in this study to lower the threshold of first-aid education.","E-BUSINESS: DIGITAL EMPOWERMENT FOR AN INTELLIGENT FUTURE, PT I, WHICEB 2023",2023,"Guo, HJ; Wang, XF; Liu, XX; Ju, XF",10.1007/978-3-031-32299-0_15,,WOS:001329869300015,A

The neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio is a promising biomarker for predicting mortality in patients with systemic inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the association between neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio and in-hospital mortality in pediatric patients with acute fulminant myocarditis undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and to develop a PEACE model for predicting mortality in these patients.MethodsThis retrospective study included pediatric patients diagnosed with acute fulminant myocarditis who underwent venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between July 2015 and August 2022. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the independent association between the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio and the risk of in-hospital mortality. In addition, we utilized least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to select predictive factors, ultimately developing a nomogram to predict outcomes in pediatric patients receiving venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.ResultsA total of 125 patients eligible for analysis were included in this study, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 28.8%. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Restricted cubic splines revealed a positive association between the two (Pnonlinearity = 0.84). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and backward stepwise logistic regression identified age, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, lactate levels, and the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio as key predictive factors. Using these factors, a nomogram (PEACE model) was developed to predict in-hospital mortality in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.74-0.92], with the inclusion of the neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio significantly enhancing the model's predictive accuracy.ConclusionsThe neutrophil percentage-to-albumin ratio may serve as a potential predictor for venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in-hospital mortality in pediatric patients with acute fulminant myocarditis, suggesting that inflammatory responses are associated with patient prognosis.

Using generalized linear mixed models, we estimated hospital-specific and APR-DRG-specific risk-standardized rates for in-hospital mortality, 30-day readmissions, and length-of-stay above the APR-DRG-specific 90th percentile. Interhospital variation was assessed based on estimated variance components and time trends between the 2012-2014 and 2016-2018 periods were examined.Results:There was strong evidence of interhospital variation, with statistically significant variation across the 3 outcomes for 5 APR-DRGs after accounting for patient and hospital factors: percutaneous cardiovascular procedures with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, angina pectoris, and arrhythmia. Medical diagnoses, with in particular hypertension, heart failure, angina pectoris, and cardiac arrest, showed strongest variability, with hypertension displaying the largest median odds ratio for mortality (2.51). Overall, hospitals performing at the upper-quartile level should achieve improvements to the median level, and an annual 633 deaths, 322 readmissions, and 1578 extended hospital stays could potentially be avoided.Conclusions:Analysis of interhospital variation highlights important outcome differences that are not explained by known patient or hospital characteristics.

Few studies have quantitatively characterized current demographics, diagnoses, and outcomes in the contemporary CICU. Methods: We evaluated patients in a prospective observational database, created to support quality improvement and clinical care redesign in an AHA Level 1 (advanced) CICU at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. All consecutive patients (N=2193) admitted from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 were included at the time of admission to the CICU. Results: The median age was 65 years (43% >70 years) and 44% of patients were women. Non-cardiovascular comorbidities were common, including chronic kidney disease (27%), pulmonary disease (22%), and active cancer (13%). Only 7% of CICU admissions were primarily for an acute coronary syndrome, which was the seventh most common individual diagnosis. The top three reasons for admission to the CICU were shock/hypotension (26%), cardiopulmonary arrest (11%), or primary arrhythmia without arrest (9%). Respiratory failure was a primary or major secondary reason for triage to the CICU in 17%. In-hospital mortality was 17.6%. Conclusions: In a tertiary, academic, advanced CICU, patients are elderly with a high burden of non-cardiovascular comorbid conditions.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Comprehensive Management of the Patient With Traumatic Cardiac Injury,"Cardiac injuries are rare but potentially life-threatening, with a significant proportion of victims dying before arrival at the hospital. The in-hospital mortality among patients who arrive in-hospital alive also remains significantly high, despite major advancements in trauma care including the continuous updating of the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program. Stab and gunshot wounds due to assault or self-inflicted injuries are the common causes of penetrating cardiac injuries, while motor vehicular accidents and fall from height are attributable causes of blunt cardiac injury. Rapid transport of victim to trauma care facility, prompt recognition of cardiac trauma by clinical evaluation and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination, quick decision-making to perform emergency department thoracotomy, and/or shifting the patient expeditiously to the operating room for operative intervention with ongoing resuscitation are the key components for a successful outcome in cardiac injury victims with cardiac tamponade or exsanguinating hemorrhage. Blunt cardiac injury with arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, or cardiac failure may need continuous cardiac monitoring or anesthetic care for operative procedure of other associated injuries. This mandates a multidisciplinary approach working in concert with agreed local protocols and shared goals. An anesthesiologist has a pivotal role to play as a team leader or member in the trauma pathway of severely injured patients. They are not only involved in in-hospital care as a perioperative physician but also participate in the organizational aspects of prehospital trauma systems and training of prehospital care providers/paramedics. There is sparse literature available on the anesthetic management of cardiac injury (penetrating as well as blunt) patients. This narrative review discusses the comprehensive management of cardiac injury patients, focusing on the anesthetic concerns and is guided by our experience in managing cardiac injury cases at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

Nevertheless, the relationship between PICS-relevant domains in cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and psychological distress in their family members (henceforth, PICS-F) remains underexplored. Methods: We enrolled consecutive CA patients admitted between 16 August 2021 and 28 June 2023 to an academic medical center, along with their close family members, in prospective studies. Survivors' PICS domains were: physical dependence (Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, PSMS), cognitive impairments (Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status, TICS-M), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSS) symptoms (PTSD Checklist-PCL 5), as well as PICS-F (PCL-5 Total Score). Hierarchical multivariate linear regressions examined associations between PICS-F and survivors' PICS domains. Results: Of 74 dyads (n = 148), survivors had a mean (SD) age of 56 +/- 16 years, with 61% being male and with a median hospital stay of 28 days. Family members (43% spouses) were slightly younger (52 +/- 14 years), predominantly female (72%), and of minority race/ethnicity (62%). A high prevalence of PICS assessed 28.5 days (interquartile range 10-63) post-CA was observed in survivors (78% physical dependence, 54% cognitive impairment, 30% PTSS) and in family members (30% PTSS). Survivor PTSS was significantly associated with family member distress (beta = 0.3, p = 0.02), independent of physical dependence (beta = 0.0, p = 0.9), cognitive impairment (beta = -0.1, p = 0.5), family member characteristics, and duration of hospitalization.

Dementia, which is prevalent in geriatric THA recipients, is correlated with several adverse outcomes. This study further investigated the impact of dementia on perioperative outcomes (complications, mortality, skilled nursing facilities [SNFs] transfer, total cost, and length of hospital stay [LOS]) in geriatric patients undergoing elective THA.MethodsThis study retrospectively analysed data from patients aged 65 years and older who underwent elective THA in the Nationwide inpatient sample (NIS) database from 2010 to 2019. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to reduce potential selection bias arising from differences in demographic and comorbidity factors. The Wilcoxon rank test (for continuous data) and Chi-square test (for categorical data) were used to assess demographic characteristics, comorbidities, LOS, total hospital costs, and in-hospital mortality; logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the influence of dementia on adverse outcomes.Results376 323 elective geriatric THA patient samples from the NIS database were included, with an overall dementia prevalence of 2.05%.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Prevalence of advance care planning practices among people with chronic diseases in hospital and community settings: a retrospective medical record audit,"Background Advance Care Planning (ACP) enables healthcare professionals to embrace the important process where patients think about their values in life and goals for health care, and discuss their future health care preferences with family members for a time when they are not able to make health care decisions. Despite the promotion of ACP last two decades, and well-known benefits of ACP and a written Advance Care Directive (ACD), they are still underutilised in Australia and across the world. Previous studies have provided some insights, however, an uptake of ACP and prevalence of ACDs in community settings is rarely reported. Methods The aim of this study was to determine the uptake of ACP and prevalence of ACDs among people with chronic diseases in hospital and community settings. A retrospective medical record audit of eligible patients looking for evidence of ACP was conducted in 16 research sites in eight hospital and eight community care settings. Participants included those who were admitted to one of the research sites, and who were aged 18 years and over with at least one of nine nominated chronic diseases. The primary outcome measures included the number of patients with evidence of ACP through the following practices: completion of an ACD, appointment of an Enduring Guardian (EG), or completion of a resuscitation plan. Results The overall prevalence of ACD was 2.8% (n = 28) out of 1006 audited records, and only 10 (1%) of them were legally binding. The number of EGs appointed was 39 (3.9%) across the sites. A total of 151 (15.4%) resuscitation plans were found across the eight hospital sites. 95% (n = 144) of the resuscitation plans indicated 'Not-for-resuscitation'. Conclusions The uptake of ACP is very low. Current medical recording system reveals the challenges in ACP lie in the process of storage, access and execution of the ACDs. Given that having an ACD or Enduring Guardian in place is only useful if the treating physician knows how and where to access the information, it has implications for policy, information system, and healthcare professionals' education.",BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,2021,"Jeong, S; Barrett, T; Ohr, SO; Cleasby, P; Davey, R; David, M",10.1186/s12913-021-06265-y,,WOS:000636960700001,A

The primary objective of this study was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia based on safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary activity. Methods KOMET-001 is a multicentre, open-label, multi-cohort, phase 1/2 clinical trial of ziftomenib in adults with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia. Results of the phase 1 study, conducted at 22 hospitals in France, Italy, Spain, and the USA, are presented here and comprise the dose-escalation (phase 1a) and dose-validation and expansion (phase 1b) phases. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less. For phase 1a, patients (all molecular subtypes) received ziftomenib (50-1000 mg) orally once daily in 28-day cycles. For phase 1b, patients with NPM1 mutations or with KMT2A rearrangements were randomly assigned (1:1) using third-party interactive response technology to two parallel dose cohorts (200 mg and 600 mg ziftomenib). Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose in phase 1a, and safety, remission rates, and pharmacokinetics supporting recommended phase 2 dose determination in phase 1b. Analyses were performed in all patients who received at least one dose of ziftomenib (modified intention-to-treat population). Phase 1a/1b is complete. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04067336, and the EU Clinical Trials register, EudraCT 2019-001545-41. Findings From Sept 12, 2019, to Aug 19, 2022, 83 patients received 50-1000 mg ziftomenib (39 [47%] were male and 44 [53%] were female). Median follow-up was 22<middle dot>3 months (IQR 15<middle dot>4-30<middle dot>2). Of 83 patients, the most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia (20 [24%]), febrile neutropenia (18 [22%]), pneumonia (16 [19%]), differentiation syndrome (12 [15%]), thrombocytopenia (11 [13%]), and sepsis (ten [12%]). Overall, 68 of 83 patients had serious adverse events, with two reported treatment-related deaths (one differentiation syndrome and one cardiac arrest). Differentiation syndrome rate and severity influenced the decision to halt enrolment of patients with KMT2A rearrangements. In Phase 1b, no responses were reported in patients treated at the 200 mg dose level. At the recommended phase 2 dose of 600 mg, nine (25%) of 36 patients with KMT2A rearrangement or NPM1 mutation had complete remission or complete remission with partial haematologic recovery. Seven (35%) of 20 patients with NPM1 mutation treated at the recommended phase 2 dose had a complete remission. Interpretation Ziftomenib showed promising clinical activity with manageable toxicity in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Lipopolysaccharide binding protein inhibitory peptide alters hepatic inflammatory response post-hemorrhagic shock,"Translocation of microorganisms and endotoxin (LPS) across the gastrointestinal mucosa may exacerbate the inflammatory response and potentiate hepatic injury associated with hemorrhagic shock. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) augments LPS signaling through TLR4. In addition, evidence suggests that TLR4-mediated injury in liver ischemia/reperfusion occurs through the IRF-3/MyD88 independent pathway. We hypothesized that administration of LBP inhibiting peptide, LBPK95A, given at the time of resuscitation would reduce liver inflammation and injury in a murine model of hemorrhagic shock by limiting LPS-induced activation of the MyD88 independent pathway. Hemorrhagic shock was induced in male, C57BL/6 mice; a mean arterial blood pressure of 35 mmHg was maintained for 2.5 h. LBPK95A peptide or equal volume Lactated Ringer's solution was administered followed by fluid resuscitation. Mice were sacrificed at 2 and 6 h post-resuscitation. At 2 h, liver mRNA levels revealed a significant reduction in IFN-beta, a cytokine produced via the MyD88 independent pathway, with LBPK95A treatment. However, mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, a cytokine associated with the MyD88 dependent pathway, were unaffected by treatment. The LBP inhibitory peptide did selectively reduce activation of TLR4 signaling via the IRF-3/MyD88 independent pathway. These results suggest that LBP promotes cytokine production through the MyD88 independent pathway during hemorrhagic shock.",INNATE IMMUNITY,2012,"Cotroneo, TM; Nemzek-Hamlin, JA; Bayliss, J; Su, GL",10.1177/1753425912444641,,WOS:000311333400009,A

The focus has been on determining the cost-effectiveness of extreme preterm infants and those at threshold of viability. While the costs of care have an inverse relationship with gestational age (GA) and the lifetime medical costs of the extreme preterm can be as high as $450,000, the total NICU expenditure are skewed towards the care of moderate and late preterm infants who form the main bulk of patients. Neonatal intensive care, has been found to be very cost-effective at $1,000 per term infant per QALY and $9,100 for extreme preterm survivor per QALY. For low and LMIC, where NICU resources are limited, the costs of NICU care is lower largely due to a patient profile of more term and preterm of greater GAs and correspondingly less intensity of care. Public health measures, neonatal resuscitation training, empowerment of nurses to do resuscitation, increasing the accessibility to essential newborn care are recommended cheaper cost-effective measures to reduce neonatal mortality in countries with high neonatal mortality rate, whilst upgraded neonatal intensive care services are needed to further reduce neonatal mortality rate once below 15 per 1,000 livebirths. Economic evaluation of neonatal intensive care should also include post discharge costs which mainly fall on the health, social and educational sectors. Strategies to reduce neonatal intensive care costs could include more widespread implementation of cost-effective methods of improving neonatal outcome and reducing neonatal morbidities, including access to antenatal care, perinatal interventions to delay preterm delivery wherever feasible, improving maternal health status and practising cost saving and effective neonatal intensive care treatment.",TRANSLATIONAL PEDIATRICS,2019,"Cheah, IGS",10.21037/tp.2019.07.03,,WOS:000477755400009,A

Before the conference, invitees were given a questionnaire and provided with current literature regarding FP. A modified Delphi process was used to develop consensus, including use of multiple questionnaires and breakouts for discussion of specific issues. Participants were encouraged to develop consensus recommendations based on the literature and discussions. Changes in attitude were tracked with repeat questionnaires. Results of the conference were circulated to participants for review and revision. Consensus recommendations include (I) consider FP as an option for families during pediatric procedures and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, (2) offer FP as an option after assessing factors that could adversely affect the interaction, (3) if family is not offered the option for FP, document the reasons why, (4) always consider the safety of the health care team, (5) develop in-hospital transport and transfer policies and procedures for FP, such as family member definition, preparation of the family, handling disagreements, and providing support for the staff, (6) obtain legal review of policies, (7) include education in FP in all core curricula and orientation for health care providers, (8) promote research into best methods for education; effects of FP on patients, family, and staff; best practices for FP; and legal issues regarding FP, among others.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Failure to rescue-rapid response systems: A making healthcare safer rapid review,"Background Rapid response systems (RRSs) were developed to respond to early warnings of unexpected deterioration, but their effectiveness may be limited by factors impacting RRS activation (afferent limb) or response (efferent limb). Despite decades of RRS implementation, patients still experience unrecognized deterioration with associated worse outcomes.Methods This rapid review used modified search strategies to focus on the most valuable studies performed in the United States. Citations were screened by one reviewer with artificial intelligence as a second reviewer at the title/abstract review stage. The full text of eligible articles was then reviewed by a single team member to confirm eligibility. One reviewer completed the data abstraction, and a second reviewer checked the first reviewer's abstraction.Results Three categories of interventions were identified: implementation of a new RRS, and modifications to the afferent limb and/or efferent limb of an existing RRS. RRSs may have a large impact in reducing in-hospital mortality and an even greater impact in reducing cardiorespiratory arrest on hospital general wards in adults but the effect is unclear in children. Their impact on unanticipated intensive care unit admission is unclear. Modifications to the afferent and/or efferent limb were associated with a reduction in mortality and the incidence of cardiorespiratory arrest for adults.Conclusions RRS may have a large beneficial effect on hospital mortality and in-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest, but the strength of the evidence is low due to methodological weaknesses of the studies.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Update on the management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding,"Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a common emergency presentation requiring prompt resuscitation and management. Peptic ulcers are the most common cause of the condition. Thorough initial management with a structured approach is vital with appropriate intravenous fluid resuscitation and use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7-8 g/dL. Pre-endoscopic scoring tools enable identification of patients at high risk and at very low risk who might benefit from specific management. Endoscopy should be carried out within 24 h of presentation for patients admitted to hospital, although optimal timing for patients at a higher risk within this period is less clear. Endoscopic treatment of high risk lesions and use of subsequent high dose proton pump inhibitors is a cornerstone of non-variceal bleeding management. Variceal haemorrhage results in higher mortality than non-variceal haemorrhage and, if suspected, antibiotics and vasopressors should be administered urgently, before endoscopy. Oesophageal variceal bleeding requires endoscopic band ligation, whereas bleeding from gastric varices requires thrombin or tissue glue injection. Recurrent bleeding is managed by repeat endoscopic treatment. If uncontrolled bleeding occurs, interventional radiological embolisation or surgery is required for non-variceal bleeding or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement for variceal bleeding.",BMJ MEDICINE,2022,"Orpen-Palmer, J; Stanley, AJ",10.1136/bmjmed-2022-000202,,WOS:001169772500031,A

Veno-arterial extracorporeal life support (V-A ECLS) has been proposed to improve extremely poor pre- or postoperative conditions. Information in this respect is scarce.Methods: From the CAUTION (meChanical complicAtion of acUte myocardial infarcTion: an InternatiOnal multiceNter cohort study) database (16 different Centers, data from 2001 to 2018), we extracted adult patients who were surgically treated for post-AMI PMR and underwent pre- or/and postoperative V-A ECLS support. The end-points of this study were in-hospital survival and ECLS complications.Results: From a total of 214 post-AMI PMR patients submitted to surgery, V-A ECLS was instituted in 23 (11%) patients. The median age was 61.7 years (range 46-81 years). Preoperatively, ECLS was commenced in 10 patients (43.5%), whereas intra/postoperative in the remaining 13. The most common V-A ECLS indication was post-cardiotomy shock, followed by preoperative cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. The median duration of V-A ECLS was 4 days. V-A ECLS complications occurred in more than half of the patients. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 39.2% (9/23), compared to 22% (42/219) for the non-ECLS group.Conclusions: In post-AMI PMR patients, V-A ECLS was used in almost 10% of the patients either to promote bridge to surgery or as postoperative support.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The role of the electroencephalogram and evoked potentials after cardiac arrest,"Purpose of reviewIn comatose cardiac arrest survivors, the electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most widely used test to assess the severity of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) and guide antiseizure treatment. However, a wide variety of EEG patterns are described in literature. Moreover, the value of postarrest seizure treatment is uncertain. Absent N20 waves of short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEPs) are a specific predictor of irreversible HIBI. However, the prognostic significance of the N20 amplitude is less known.Recent findingsThe increasing adoption of standardized EEG pattern classification identified suppression and burst-suppression as 'highly-malignant' EEG patterns, accurately predicting irreversible HIBI. Conversely, continuous normal-voltage EEG is a reliable predictor of recovery from postarrest coma. A recent trial on EEG-guided antiseizure treatment in HIBI was neutral but suggested potential benefits in specific subgroups. A prognostic approach based on the amplitude rather than on the presence/absence of the N20 SSEP wave recently showed greater sensitivity for poor outcome prediction and added potential for predicting recovery.Standardized EEG terminology and quantitative approach to SSEP are promising for improving the neuroprognostic accuracy of these tests.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Norepinephrine Infusion in the Emergency Department in Septic Shock Patients: A Retrospective 2-Years Safety Report and Outcome Analysis,"Hemodynamic optimization during sepsis and septic shock is based on a prompt and large fluid resuscitation strategy associated with early administration of norepinephrine. In our hospital, norepinephrine is administered in the emergency department (ED), within a protocol-guided management context, to reduce norepinephrine infusion timing due to central line insertion. This choice, however, can be associated with side effects. Objectives: We conducted a retrospective analysis regarding the safety of norepinephrine in the ED. We also appraised the association between in-hospital mortality and predefined ED variables and patients' admission severity scores. Design, settings, and participants: This was a retrospective analysis of electronic sheets of the ED of a tertiary hospital in the North of Italy. Outcomes measure and analysis: Electronic documentation was assessed to identify local and systemic side effects. We considered two subgroups of patients according to the in-hospital clinical paths: (1) those admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU); and (2) those who received a ceiling of care decision. We collected and considered variables related to septic shock treatment in the ED and analyzed their association with in-hospital mortality. Main Results: We considered a two-year period, including 108,033 ED accesses, and ultimately analyzed data from 127 patients. Side effects related to the use of this drug were reported in five (3.9%) patients. Thirty patients (23.6%) were transferred to the ICU from the ED, of whom six (20.0%) died. Twenty-eight patients (22.0%) received a ceiling of care indication, of whom 21 (75.0%) died. Of the 69 (54.3%) finally discharged to either medical or surgical wards, 21 (30.4%) died. ICU admission was the only variable significantly associated to in-hospital mortality in the multivariable analysis [OR (95% CI) = 4.48 (1.52-13.22); p-value = 0.007]. Conclusions: Norepinephrine peripheral infusion in the ED was associated with a low incidence of adverse events requiring discontinuation (3.9%).

Direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR) improves blood flow to the vital organs after ABD. DPR reduces lung injury, but the mechanism for this is unknown. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to five groups (n = 8/group): (1) Sham (no ABD); (2) Targeted intravenous fluid (TIVF) (ABD plus enough IVF to maintain a MAP of 80 mmHg) at 2 hours post-resuscitation (RES); (3) ABD + TIVF + DPR (TIVF and 30 cc intraperitoneal 2.5% Delflex) at 2 hours post-RES; (4) ABD + TIVF at 4 hours post-RES; and (5) ABD + TIVF + DPR at 4 hours post-RES. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured using Qiagen qRT PCR. Protein levels were assessed using quantitative ELISAs and the Luminex MagPix system. Results: Use of DPR caused 5.8-fold downregulation of mRNA expression for TNF-alpha and 2.7-fold decrease for the TNF receptor compared to TIVF alone. Caspase 8 mRNA was also downregulated. Protein levels for TNF-alpha, TNF receptor, caspase 8, NF kappa B, and NF kappa B inhibitor kinase, which promotes dissociation of NF kappa B inhibitor, were reduced by DPR. Cell death markers M30 and M65 were also decreased with DPR. Conclusions: Use of DPR caused changes in the expression of multiple mRNAs and proteins in the caspase 8 apoptotic pathway.

Cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation promotes mitochondrial Ca2+ (Ca2+ overload. leading to mitochondrial injury. We investigated whether limiting sarcolemmal Na+ entry during resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) attenuates Ca-m(2+) overload and lessens myocardial dysfunction in a rat model of VF and closed-best resuscitation. Methods: hearts were harvested from 10 groups of 5 rats each representing baseline, 15 min of untreated VF, 15 min of VF with chest compression given for the last 5 min (VF/CC), and 60 min postresuscitation (PR). VF/CC and PR included four groups each randomized to receive before starting chest compression the new NHE-1 inhibitor AVE4454B (1.0 mg/kg), the Na+ channel blocker aidocaine (5.0 mg/kg), their combination, or vehicle control. The left ventricle was processed for intracellular Na+ and Ca2+, measurements. Results: limiting sarcolemmal Na+ entry attenuated cytosolic Na+ increase during VF/CC and the PR phase and prevented Ca-m(2+) overload yielding levels that corresponded to 77% and 71% of control hearts at VF/CC and PR, without differences among specific Na+-limiting interventions. Limiting sarcolemmal Na+ entry attenuated reductions in left ventricular compliance during VF and prompted higher mean aortic pressure (110 +/- 7 vs. 95 11 mmHg, P < 0.001) and higher cardiac work index (159 +/- 34 vs. 126 (-1) +/- 29 g center dot m center dot min(-1)center dot kg(-1), P < 0.05) with lesser increases in circulating,cardiac troponin I at 60 min PR.

Assessing alternative vascular access for angiography after resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) in severe pelvic trauma patients,"Introduction Pelvic fractures often result in life-threatening bleeding and hemodynamic instability. Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) has emerged as a promising strategy for patients with severe pelvic fractures, facilitating subsequent hemostatic interventions. Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) is a well-established procedure for managing pelvic fractures accompanied by hemorrhage. Ideally, an angiographic access point distinct from the initial REBOA placement is sought to maintain REBOA deflation without complete removal, thereby preventing hemodynamic instability during the procedure. However, in cases of extreme and severe pelvic trauma, gaining access for REBOA is already challenging, not to mention the additional difficulty posed by subsequent angiographic access. This study aims to assess the challenges associated with gaining access in cases where successful TAE was ultimately performed, particularly in the context of severe pelvic trauma.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the next wave of technological advancements that have the potential to make a huge splash in clinical medicine. UAVs, originally developed for military use, are making their way into the public and private sector. Because they can be flown autonomously and can reach almost any geographical location, the significance of UAVs are becoming increasingly apparent in the medical field.Materials and Methods:We conducted a comprehensive review of the English language literature via the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using search terms unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, and drone. Preference was given to clinical trials and review articles that addressed the keywords and clinical medicine.Results:Potential applications of UAVs in medicine are broad. Based on articles identified, we grouped UAV application in medicine into three categories: (1) Prehospital Emergency Care; (2) Expediting Laboratory Diagnostic Testing; and (3) Surveillance. Currently, UAVs have been shown to deliver vaccines, automated external defibrillators, and hematological products. In addition, they are also being studied in the identification of mosquito habitats as well as drowning victims at beaches as a public health surveillance modality.Conclusions:These preliminary studies shine light on the possibility that UAVs may help to increase access to healthcare for patients who may be otherwise restricted from proper care due to cost, distance, or infrastructure.

Although emergency medical service (EMS) played a pivotal role for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the corresponding data in China are limited. Methods: An observational analysis was performed in 26,305 STEMI patients, who were documented in China acute myocardial infarction (CAMI) Registry and treated in 162 hospitals from January 1st, 2013 to January 31th, 2016. We compared the differences such as demographic factors, social factors, medical history, risk factors, socioeconomic distribution and treatment strategies between EMS transport group and self-transport group. Results: Only 4336 patients (16.5%) were transported by EMS. Patients with symptom onset outside, out-of hospital cardiac arrest and presented to province-level hospital were more likely to use EMS. Besides those factors, low systolic blood pressure, severe dyspnea or syncope, and high Killip class were also positively related to EMS activation. Notably, compared to self-transport, use of EMS was associated with a shorter prehospital delay (median, 180 vs. 245 min, P < 0.0001) but similar door-to-needle time (median, 45 min vs. 52 min, P = 0.1400) and door-to-balloon time (median, 105 min vs. 103 min, P = 0.1834). Conclusions: EMS care for STEMI is greatly underused in China. EMS transport is associated with shorter onset-to-door time and higher rate of reperfusion, but not substantial reduction in treatment delays or mortality rate.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib-venetoclax compared with ibrutinib-placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. Methods SYMPATICO is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study performed at 84 hospitals in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. Eligible patients were adults (aged >= 18 years) with pathologically confirmed relapsed or refractory MCL after one to five previous lines of therapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral ibrutinib 560 mg once daily concurrently with oral venetoclax (5-week ramp-up to 400 mg once daily) or placebo for 2 years, then single-agent ibrutinib 560 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Randomisation and treatment assignment occurred via interactive response technology using a stratified permuted block scheme (block sizes of 2 and 4) with stratification by ECOG performance status, previous lines of therapy, and tumour lysis syndrome risk category. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.

Findings Between April 26, 2018, and Aug 28, 2019, 267 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned; 134 to the ibrutinib-venetoclax group and 133 to the ibrutinib-placebo group. 211 (79%) of 267 patients were male and 56 (21%) were female. With a median follow-up of 51<middle dot>2 months (IQR 48<middle dot>2-55<middle dot>3), median progression-free survival was 31<middle dot>9 months (95% CI 22<middle dot>8-47<middle dot>0) in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group and 22<middle dot>1 months (16<middle dot>5-29<middle dot>5) in the ibrutinib- placebo group (hazard ratio 0<middle dot>65 [95% CI 0<middle dot>47-0<middle dot>88]; p=0<middle dot>0052). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (42 [31%] of 134 patients in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group vs 14 [11%] of 132 patients in the ibrutinib- placebo group), thrombocytopenia (17 [13%] vs ten [8%]), and pneumonia (16 [12%] vs 14 [11%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 81 (60%) of 134 patients in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group and in 79 (60%) of 132 patients in the ibrutinib-placebo group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in three (2%) of 134 patients in the ibrutinib-venetoclax group (n=1 COVID-19 infection, n=1 cardiac arrest, and n=1 respiratory failure) and in two (2%) of 132 patients in the ibrutinib-placebo group (n=1 cardiac failure and n=1 COVID-19-related pneumonia). Interpretation The combination of ibrutinib-venetoclax significantly improved progression-free survival compared with ibrutinib-placebo in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. The safety profile was consistent with known safety profiles of the individual drugs.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Clinical outcomes following shock team implementation for cardiogenic shock: a systematic review,"BackgroundCardiogenic shock is a critical cardiac condition characterized by low cardiac output leading to end-organ hypoperfusion and associated with high in-hospital mortality rates. It can manifest following acute myocardial infarction or acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure. Despite advancements, mortality rates remain elevated, prompting interest in multidisciplinary approaches to improve outcomes. This manuscript presents a review focused on the concept of a cardiogenic shock team and its potential impact on patient management and outcomes.MethodsA comprehensive search was performed on March 19, 2023, covering PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library. We included primary studies (prospective and retrospective) only and evaluated their quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Scale. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023440354).ResultsSix relevant studies with 2066 cardiogenic shock patients were included, of which 1071 were managed by shock teams and 995 received standard care. Findings from the reviewed studies indicated the favorable outcomes associated with implementing cardiogenic shock teams. Patients managed by these teams exhibited higher 30-day and in-hospital survival rates compared to those without team intervention. The implementation of cardiogenic shock teams was linked to reduced in-hospital and intensive care unit mortality rates. Additionally, shock team involvement was associated with shorter door-to-balloon times.ConclusionThe findings suggest that cardiogenic shock teams play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes through earlier detection and timely interventions.

Although step down unit (SDU) patients have continuous non-invasive physiologic monitoring of vital signs and a ratio of one nurse to four to six patients, detection of CRI is still suboptimal. Telemedicine provides additional surveillance but, due to high costs and unclear investment returns, is not routinely used in SDUs. Rapid response teams have been tested as possible approaches to support CRI patients outside the intensive care unit with mixed outcomes. Technology-enabled early warning scores, though rigorously studied, may not detect subtle instability. Efforts to utilise nursing intuition as a means to promote early identification of CRI have been explored, but the problem still persists. Monitoring systems hold promise, but nursing surveillance remains the key to reliable early detection and recognition. Research directed towards improving nursing surveillance and facilitating decision-making is needed to ensure safe patient outcomes and prevent CRI. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A comprehensive analysis of oncological gastric surgery in Germany between 2008 and 2018,"IntroductionMajor gastric surgery for distal esophageal and gastric cancer has a strong impact on the quality of life, morbidity, and mortality. Especially in elderly patients reaching their life expectancy, the responsible use and extent of gastrectomy are imperative to achieve a balance between harm and benefit. In the present study, the reimbursement database (German Diagnosis Related Groups (G-DRG) database) of the Statistical Office of the Federal Republic of Germany was queried to evaluate the morbidity and mortality of patients aged above or below 75 years following gastrectomy. Material and methodsAll patients in Germany undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (ST), total gastrectomy (T), or gastrectomy combined with esophagectomy (TE) for gastric or distal esophageal cancer (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems Version 10 (ICD-10) C15.2, C15.5, and C16.0-C16.9) between 2008 and 2018 were included. Intraoperative and postoperative complications as well as comorbidities, in-hospital mortality, and the extent of surgery were assessed by evaluating ICD-10 and operation and procedure key (Operationen- und Prozedurenschlussel) codes. ResultsA total of 67,389 patients underwent oncologic gastric resection in Germany between 2008 and 2018. In total, 21,794 patients received ST, 41,825 received T, and 3,466 received TE, respectively. In 304 cases, the combinations of these, in fact, mutually exclusive procedures were encoded. The proportion of patients aged 75 years or older was 51.4% (n = 11,207) for ST, 32.6% (n = 13,617) for T, and 28.1% (n = 973) for TE. The in-hospital mortality of elderly patients was significantly increased in all three groups. (p < 0.0001) General complications such as respiratory failure (p = 0.0054), acute renal failure (p < 0.0001), acute myocardial failure (p < 0.0001), and the need for resuscitation (ST/T: p < 0.0001/TE: p = 0.0218) were significantly increased after any kind of gastrectomy. Roux-en Y was the most commonly applied reconstruction technique in both young and elderly patients. Regarding lymphadenectomy, systematic D2 dissection was performed less frequently in older patients than in the younger collective in the case of ST and T as well as D3 dissection. Peritonectomy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy were uncommon in elderly patients alongside ST and T compared to younger patients (p < 0.0001). ConclusionThe clinical outcome of major oncological gastric surgery is highly dependent on a patient's age.

Emergency resuscitative thoracotomies (ERTs) are life-saving procedures for traumatic cardiac arrest or severe haemorrhage, but their outcomes remain variable and are influenced by several factors, including timing, mechanism of injury and the presence of initial signs of life. Studies on ERT outcomes predominantly originate from well-resourced settings, leaving a gap in understanding their effectiveness in resource-constrained environments. Objective. To conduct a prospective audit of ERTs performed at a level 1 trauma unit over a 1-year period (1 April 2023-31 March 2024), assessing initial presentation characteristics, indications for ERT and subsequent outcomes in terms of survival and complications. Methods. A prospective analysis of 19 consecutive patients who underwent ERT was performed. Data included demographics, mechanism of injury, initial physiological parameters, ERT indications, resuscitation times, blood product transfusions, complications and survival to discharge. Results. The study comprised predominantly male patients (94.74%) with a wide age range (19-68 years). Penetrating trauma was the most common mechanism of injury (94.44%). An association was observed between shorter interval between fluid resuscitation time and commencement of ERT time and survival. Elevated lactate levels and acidosis were more frequent in non-survivors. A high mortality rate was noted (only one patient survived). Conclusion. This study did not find statistically significant results, but recognising the importance of prompt and ongoing resuscitation in improving survival after ERT is consistent with existing literature. However, the small sample size significantly limits the ability to apply these findings to other cases. Larger studies are necessary to definitively establish the impact of factors such as resource limitations on ERT outcomes in under-resourced settings.

Analysis of the effectiveness of in-hospital transfer care based on the STABLE (sugar and safe care, temperature, airway, blood pressure, lab work, emotional support) technique in critically ill neonates. Methods. Retrospective analysis of the case data of 180 critically ill neonates transferred to the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) via the delivery room (operating room) in our hospital from April 2020 to December 2021. Of which, 88 newborns from April 2020 to February 2021 were resuscitated by conventional resuscitation and then transferred to the NICU by the nurses in the delivery room (operating room) through the green channel, and they were recorded as the control group; and 92 newborns from March to December 2021 were transferred to the NICU by the NICU transfer nurses who arrived at the delivery room (operating room) earlier and used the in-hospital transfer care based on STABLE technology, and they were recorded as the intervention group. The indicators to be assessed were the execution pass rate in the simulated assessment of the transfer emergency procedure for both groups of transporters, execution times of the various subprocesses during the transfer procedure for both groups of transporters, accidents in transit, and blood glucose, blood pressure, body temperature, respiration, blood gas indicators, and family satisfaction of children in both groups after transfer. Results. The total execution pass rate for transporters was higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The execution times of the various subprocesses during the transfer procedure of transporters were shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of accidents in transit was lower in the intervention group than in the control group (P < 0.05). After transfer, the blood glucose, blood pressure, body temperature, respiratory, and blood gas indicators of the children in the intervention group were all more stable than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The satisfaction of the families of the children in the intervention group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion. The implementation of transfer care based on STABLE technology for newborns in urgent need of in-hospital transfer can effectively improve the comprehensive quality and emergency response ability of transfer nurses and shorten the in-hospital transfer time, and the incidence of adverse reactions during the transfer of children is less, the vital signs are stable, and the satisfaction of family members is high, which is of promotion value.",EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,2022,"Fang, L; Pei, JR; Jiang, SQ",10.1155/2022/8250655,,WOS:000883467400009,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta for non-traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage,"Background Hemorrhagic shock is the second leading cause of death in blunt trauma and a significant cause of mortality in non-trauma patients. The increased use of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) as a bridge to definitive control for massive hemorrhage has provided promising results in the trauma population. We describe an extension of this procedure to our hemodynamically unstable non-trauma patients. Methods This is a retrospective review of patients requiring REBOA for end stage non-traumatic abdominal hemorrhage from our tertiary care facility. After excluding patients with trauma, supradiaphragmatic bleed and thoracic/abdominal aortic aneurysms, demographics, etiology of bleed, REBOA placement specifics, complications and outcomes were reviewed. Results From August 2013 to August 2016, 11 patients were identified requiring REBOA placement for hemodynamic instability from non-traumatic abdominal hemorrhage. Average patient age was 54.9 (SD 15.2). Sixty-four percent suffered cardiac arrest prior to REBOA, with mean shock index of 1.29. Average time from diagnosis of shock (MAP <= 65) or signs of bleeding to placement of REBOA was 177 min. The leading etiologies of hemorrhage were ruptured visceral aneurysm and massive upper gastrointestinal bleed. REBOA was placed by both acute care and vascular surgeons. The procedure was mainly completed in the operating room in 82% of the patients and at the bedside in 18%. One patient expired before operative repair. Definitive surgical control of the source of bleeding was obtained by open surgical approach (n = 6) and combined surgical and endovascular approach (n = 4). In-hospital survival was 64%. There were no local complications related to REBOA placement. Conclusion Similar to the trauma population, REBOA is an adjunctive technique for proximal control of bleeding as well as resuscitation in end stage non-traumatic intra-abdominal hemorrhage. We propose an algorithmic approach to REBOA use in this population and a larger prospective review is necessary to determine both the timing of REBOA placement and which non-traumatic patients may benefit from this technique.

Early fluid resuscitation with Normal saline (NS) may lead to hyperchloremia and AKI, which prompted interest in using balanced crystalloids. However, the optimal choice of crystalloid fluid remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the effects of NS versus Physiomax on plasma chloride levels and AKI incidence during early resuscitation in patients with predicted severe AP (pSAP). Methods: A single-center, prospective, randomized study was conducted between November 2022 and December 2023 at PGIMER, Chandigarh, India. 112 patients with pSAP were enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive either NS or Physiomax for fluid resuscitation over the first 48 h. Primary outcome was plasma chloride concentration at 48 h. Secondary outcomes included AKI incidence, MAKE-30 events, ICU admissions, and mortality. Results: Baseline and clinical parameters were comparable between groups. At 48 h, plasma chloride levels were significantly higher in NS group (114.1 +/- 4.3 mmol/L) versus Physiomax group (108.1 +/- 3.2 mmol/L; p < 0.001). AKI occurred in 41 % of NS group while 21.4 % in Physiomax group (p = 0.03). MAKE-30 events were more common in NS group (17.9 % vs. 5.4 %; p = 0.008). ICU admission rates were also significantly higher with NS infusion (28.6 % vs. 10.7 %; p = 0.03). No significant differences in hospital length of stay, mortality, or other complications were observed in between groups (p > 0.05).

To address this, the ratio of Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Heart Rate (HR), known as the Reverse Shock Index (RSI), is measured. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of RSI calculation in assessing prognosis. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective observational study in which data were retrospectively collected on trauma patients treated in the Emergency Room (ER) at Dhiraj Hospital, Sumandeep Vidyapeeth Deemed to be University, Vadodara, Gujarat, India, from January 2021 to December 2022. Patients involved in road traffic accidents, fall from a height of >= 6 m, assault, and machinery injuries were included. Upon arrival, vital signs such as HR, SBP, Respiratory Rate (RR), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), associated injuries, and in -hospital mortality were documented. Any resuscitative procedures required, such as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), intubation, oxygen therapy, chest tube insertion, and blood transfusion, were also recorded. The RSI was calculated for all trauma patients and divided into two groups (RSI <1 and RSI >= 1). The t -test was performed with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Results: Out of 363 patients, data from 320 patients were included. Among them, 55 patients (17.2%) had RSI <1, and 265 patients (82.8%) had RSI >= 1. Patients with RSI <1 exhibited lower GCS scores, tachypnoea (RR >29), or bradypnoea (RR <10), along with higher mortality rates. These patients also required resuscitative interventions.

We sought to determine whether TTA is associated with outcomes of FN. Procedure A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted of 1,628 FN admissions from 653 patients from 2001 to 2009. Outcome variables included (1) an adverse event (AE) composite of in-hospital mortality, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission within 24hours of presentation, and/or fluid resuscitation 40ml/kg within 24hours of presentation and (2) length of stay (LOS). TTA was measured as a continuous variable and in 60-minute intervals. Mixed regression models were constructed to evaluate associations of TTA with the outcome variables after adjusting for relevant covariates including cancer diagnosis, degree of myelosuppression, and presence of bacteremia. Results The composite AE outcome occurred in 11.1% of admissions including 0.7% in-hospital mortality, 4.7% PICU admission, and 10.1% fluid resuscitation. In univariate analysis, TTA was associated with the composite AE outcome (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.64) but not LOS. In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for relevant covariates, 60-minute TTA intervals were associated with the composite AE outcome (61-120minutes vs. 60minutes, OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01-3.26). Unexpectedly, admission from the emergency department (ED) was also independently associated with the composite AE outcome (ED vs. clinic, OR 3.15, 95% CI 1.95-5.09).

It is a retrospective cohort study. Multi-institutional data for purposes of this study were obtained from the extracorporeal life support organization registry Neonates with CHD supported with ECMO during 2005-2010. Of 1,898 neonates with CHD supported with ECMO, 273 (14%) had neurologic injury. Birth weight less than 3 kg (odds ratio [OR]: 1.5; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.1-1.9), pre-ECMO blood pH <= 7.15 (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ECMO (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.5-2.0) increased neurologic injury. In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with neurologic injury compared with those without (73% vs. 53%; p < 0.001). Neonates with CHD undergoing ECMO are highly vulnerable to acute neurologic injury regardless of cardiac lesion-specific physiology or the occurrence of cardiac surgery. The incidence of neurologic injuries in this population is higher in sicker patients. Severity of illness should therefore become the main target for improvement.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Clinical Management and Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death,"Despite the revolutionary advancements in the past 3 decades in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with device-based therapy, sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains an enormous public health burden. Survivors of SCD are generally at high risk for recurrent events. The clinical management of such patients requires a multidisciplinary approach from postresuscitative care to a thorough cardiovascular investigation in an attempt to identify the underlying substrate, with potential to eliminate or modify the triggers through catheter ablation and ultimately an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for prompt treatment of recurrences in those at risk. Early recognition of low left ventricular ejection fraction as a strong predictor of death and association of ventricular arrhythmias with sudden death led to significant investigation with antiarrhythmic drugs. The lack of efficacy and the proarrhythmic effects of drugs catalyzed the development and investigation of the ICD through several major clinical trials that proved the efficacy of ICD as a bedrock tool to detect and promptly treat life-threatening arrhythmias. The ICD therapy is routinely used for primary prevention of SCD in patients with cardiomyopathy and high risk inherited arrhythmic conditions and secondary prevention in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest. This compendium will review the clinical management of those surviving SCD and discuss landmark studies of antiarrhythmic drugs, ICD, and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of SCD.",CIRCULATION RESEARCH,2015,"Yousuf, O; Chrispin, J; Tomaselli, GF; Berger, RD",10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.116.304555,,WOS:000357403300010,A

Thirty-eight lifeguards were randomized into SG and control (CG) groups. All participants were required to act in a simulated imminent childbirth with a maternal-fetal simulator (PROMPT Flex, Laerdal, Norway). The CG acted autonomously, while the SG group was video-assisted by a midwife through SG (Vuzix Blade, New York, NY, USA). The video assistance was based on the OHB protocol, speaking and receiving images on the SG. The performance time, compliance with the protocol steps, and perceived performance with the SG were evaluated. The midwife's video assistance with SG allowed 35% of the SG participants to perform the complete OHB protocol. No CG participant was able to perform it (p = 0.005). All OHB protocol variables were significantly better in the SG group than in the CG (p < 0.05). Telemedicine through video assistance with SG is feasible so that a lifeguard with no knowledge of childbirth care can act according to the recommendations in a simulated, unplanned, uncomplicated OHB.

This part addresses fluid removal in the de-escalation phase of shock management.MethodsThis guideline was formulated by an international panel of clinical experts, methodologists, and patient representatives. A literature search was conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults published up to February 2025. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was applied to evaluate the certainty of evidence and to move from evidence to decision.ResultsBased on data from 13 RCTs, the panel issued three conditional recommendations. The panel suggested de-escalation of fluid therapy over no de-escalation in critically ill adults after the acute phase of fluid resuscitation (low certainty evidence). They suggested protocolized fluid removal by diuretics over usual care in critically ill patients after the acute phase of fluid resuscitation (moderate certainty evidence). A conditional recommendation was issued against the routine use of ultrafiltration or extracorporeal fluid removal in critically ill adults after the acute phase of fluid resuscitation, without other indication for RRT (low certainty evidence). There was limited evidence to comment on fluid removal in specific patient cohorts.ConclusionsThis ESICM guideline provides three recommendations to inform clinicians on fluid removal during the de-escalation phase in critically ill patients with shock who no longer need fluid resuscitation.",INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE,2025,"Ostermann, M; Alshamsi, F; Raventos, AA; Cecconi, M; Ichai, C; Jones, C; Malbrain, MLNG; Monnet, X; Nalos, M; Peng, ZY; Pfortmueller, CA; Prowle, J; Ranzani, O; Shankar-Hari, M; Wong, A; Moller, MH; De Backer, D",10.1007/s00134-025-08058-x,,WOS:001552628800001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Sociodemographic Disparities and Impact of Palliative Care Utilization During End-of-Life Hospitalizations in Patients with Gastric Cancer,"Background: Gastric cancer is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage and is associated with high symptom burden. Palliative care can enhance quality of life, provide symptom relief, and support end-of-life planning. However, disparities in access may lead to inequitable care, particularly among vulnerable populations with advanced diseases such as gastric cancer. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the National Inpatient Sample (2016-2020), a nationally representative database of U.S. hospitalizations, to identify predictors of palliative care utilization and its impact on outcomes among gastric cancer patients who died during hospitalization. Multivariable regression models assessed associations with length of stay (LOS), hospital charges, and intensive interventions. Results: Among 13,435 weighted hospitalizations ending in death, 57.6% received palliative care. Black patients had 32% lower odds of receiving palliative care than White patients (aOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.54-0.82). Higher palliative care use was associated with greater income, large hospitals, urban teaching hospitals, and private/other insurance. In adjusted analyses, palliative care was linked to a $36,240 reduction in hospital charges (95% CI: -$51,506 to -$20,974, p < 0.01), with no significant difference in LOS. Palliative care was associated with higher odds of DNR status (aOR: 4.77, 95% CI: 3.99-5.70, p < 0.01) and lower odds of CPR, mechanical ventilation, transfusion, and vasopressor use. Conclusion: Palliative care among hospitalized gastric cancer patients in the United States was associated with less intensive care and lower costs without prolonging LOS. However, significant disparities by race, income, insurance, and hospital type persist.

Traditional studies primarily focus on static fluid balance, overlooking the heterogeneity of dynamic trajectories. Methods Based on a single-center retrospective cohort, 3,142 AP patients admitted within 72 h of onset were included. Daily fluid therapy-to-body weight ratio (FWR) and CumFWR (trapezoidal AUC) were calculated. Latent Class Growth Modeling (LCGM) identified dynamic FWR trajectories within 72 h. Multivariate Cox regression analyzed the relationship between FWR and in-hospital mortality risk. Three-dimensional fitted surface plot analysis evaluated interactions between CumFWR and hematocrit. Results LCGM successfully identified five distinct dynamic fluid therapy trajectories within 72 h, showing significant clinical differences: Low Stable Group (LSG1, n = 229, 7.3%), Low-Moderate Sustained Group (LMSG2, n = 340, 10.8%), Moderate Stable Group (MSG3, n = 2073, 66.0%), Moderate-High Fluctuating Group (MHFG4, n = 231, 7.4%), and High Sustained Group (HSG5, n = 269, 8.6%). Multivariate Cox regression revealed significantly increased in-hospital mortality risk compared to MSG3 for both MHFG4 (adjusted HR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.15-3.78) and HSG5 (adjusted HR = 2.91, 95%CI 1.77-4.79). Furthermore, each 1 standard deviation increase in CumFWR was associated with a 47% increased mortality risk (HR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.26-1.72). Three-dimensional fitted surface plot demonstrated high mortality risk between high CumFWR and abnormal hematocrit (low/high HCT), particularly prominent in the HSG5 group (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study reveals five distinct dynamic trajectory patterns of early fluid therapy in AP. High-load sustained or fluctuating therapy significantly increases mortality risk.

The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool was applied to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Results Three of the 625 identified articles were included, which all used a before-and-after study design.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Haemodynamic management of septic shock,"Septic shock is a significant challenge in the management of patients with burns and traumatic injuries when complicated by infection, necessitating prompt and effective haemodynamic support. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current strategies for vasopressor and fluid management in septic shock, with the aim to optimize patient outcomes. With regard to vasopressor management, we elaborate on the pharmacologic profiles and clinical applications of catecholamines, vasopressin derivatives, angiotensin II, and other vasoactive agents. Noradrenaline remains central to septic shock management. The addition of vasopressin, when sequentially added to noradrenaline, offers a non-catecholaminergic vasoactive effect with some clinical benefits and risks of adverse effects. Emerging agents such as angiotensin II and hydroxocobalamin are highlighted for their roles in catecholamine-resistant vasodilatory shock. Next, for fluid management, crystalloids are currently preferred for initial resuscitation, with balanced crystalloids showing benefits over saline. The application of albumin in septic shock warrants further research. High-quality evidence does not support large-volume fluid resuscitation, and an individualized strategy based on haemodynamic parameters, including lactate clearance and capillary refill time, is recommended. The existing knowledge suggests that early vasopressor initiation, particularly noradrenaline, may be critical in cases where fluid resuscitation takes inadequate effect. Management of refractory septic shock remains challenging, with novel agents like angiotensin II and methylene blue showing potential in recent studies.

A total of 28 women participated and were randomized into two groups. Brief Psychotherapy (PB) (average of six sessions) was administered in the Control Group, and RIME (three sessions) and BP (average of five sessions) were applied in the RIME Group. The quantitative results indicated a significant improvement (38.3%) in the Perception of Quality of Life after RIME according to the WHOQOL, compared both to the BP of the Control Group (12.5%), and the BP of the RIME Group (16.2%). There was a significant improvement in Self-esteem (Rosenberg) after RIME (14.6%) compared to the BP of the Control Group (worsened 35.9%), and the BP of the RIME Group (8.3%). The improvement in well-being, considering the focus worked on (Visual Analog Scale), was significant in the RIME Group (bad to good), as well as in the Control Group (unpleasant to good).

The overall mortality rate for these patients was 25% with 88% (77/88) of these deaths occurring within 30 days of birth. Eleven infants died after more than 60 days of mechanical ventilation.  Seven of these late deaths were sudden, unexpected in hospital deaths. Sudden deaths occurred at a mean (uncorrected) age of 12 months (range, 4 to 27 months), during periods, when infants appeared to be stable or clincially improving, were unrelated to recent respiratory exacerbations, and occurred despite prompt resuscitative efforts. Four infants still required mechanical ventilation, and 4 had tracheostomies at the time of death. All of the infants had chronic hypercarbia (> 50 mm Hg) and  an elevated serum bicarbonate level (> 30 mmol/L), but not hyponatremia, hypochloremia (< 80 mmol/L) or alkalemia. Left and right ventricular hypertrophy, multiple drug therapy, recurrent cyanotic episodes, and frequent unexplained fevers were common. In comparison with 17 bronchopulonary dysplasia survivors who required longer than 60 days of ventilation therapy, the late deaths group more frequently had left ventricular hypertrophy and received prolonged combination theophylline anhydrous and .beta.-adrenergic agonist therapy.

The charts of 11 male patients injured in a 1999 foundry explosion and brought to Baystate Medical Center (BMC), a level I trauma center, were reviewed. All patients sustained deep partial and full thickness burns. The injury severity score (ISS) ranged from 9 to 75. Five patients had total body surface area (TBSA) burns of 10% to 50% and 6 patients had TBSA burns of 70% to 95%. Transfer times from the scene to BMC ranged from less than 5 minutes to 22 minutes. All 11 were initially triaged, resuscitated, and evaluated at BMC. Of the 9 patients transferred to verified burn units, 8 were intubated, 6 of 6 had negative abdominal ultrasounds, 4 had undergone escharatomies, and 1 had undergone bronchoscopy before transfer. Nine critically injured burn patients with ISS of 9 to 75 were transferred from BMC to verified burn units. For 8 of these patients, the average time from triage, evaluation, and treatment to transfer was 2 hours. The ninth patient was initially admitted overnight then promptly transferred after re-evaluation of his hand burns indicated a need for more specialized care. Two of 9 transferred patients, both with ISS of 75 died. Although 7 other patients had prolonged and complex courses, none of their subsequent complications were referable to missed injuries from this transferring facility.

The clinical impact of these devices will be predicated, in part, by absolute survival benefits but also by their relative advantages over alternative therapies in terms of survival, safety, morbidity, quality of life, and cost. The impact on public health will depend on the effectiveness of screening methods for identification of populations likely to benefit from primary prevention. Risk stratification algorithms are now being tested in several ongoing clinical trials. Dilution of benefit by competing illnesses may occur to different extents in individual patient populations. The economic impact is predicated on the future cost of ICD systems, limitation of hospitalization costs associated with this therapy, and accurate prospective stratification in primary prevention populations. Cost efficacy analyses and quality of life assessment in ongoing and future clinical trials are essential to the development of this therapy and its diffusion into different health care systems.

Patients transported to hospital with sepsis often do not receive treatment until they are assessed in emergency departments. Initiation of treatments by paramedics at the point of first contact may improve outcomes for these patients. Methods and analysis The study design involves two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted using a 2x2 factorial design comparing use of (1) early intramuscular ceftriaxone versus placebo and (2) an early liberal intravenous fluid strategy (up to 2 L normal saline) versus usual care resuscitation guided by paramedic medical directives. Patients who are >= 18 years of age will be eligible for inclusion if they have sepsis, defined as (1) paramedic suspicion of infection, (2) fever (temperature >= 38.0 degrees C measured by paramedic or history of fever during the previous 24 hours), and (3) hypotension: SBP <100 mm Hg. The primary outcome is mortality prior to hospital discharge or within 90 days of admission. Secondary outcomes are all-cause mortality at 90 days after enrolment; organ dysfunction during first 24 hours (mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, dialysis) and hospitalisation (mechanical ventilation; dialysis); rates and duration of hospital admission; rates of ICU admission during index hospitalisation; discharge destination; proportion of patients with positive blood cultures obtained in hospital (first 24 hours); microbiological profile including distribution of microorganism species and resistant organisms; proportion of patients receiving additional antibiotics within 6 hours and within 24 hours of hospital admission; frequency distribution of first antibiotics (if any) delivered within 24 hours of hospital arrival; mean time to antibiotics delivered within 24 hours of hospital arrival (if any); proportion of patients receiving fluid bolus (>250 mL) within 24 hours of hospital arrival; total amount of crystalloid infused during transport and first 24 hours of hospitalisation; and proportion of enrolled patients not suspected to have sepsis or infection by emergency department physicians. Safety outcomes include the proportion of patients with pulmonary oedema during transport to hospital and on initial chest X-ray and the proportion of patients with anaphylaxis or suspected allergic reactions to study medication.

Sepsis-3 has replaced the earlier systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)-based diagnoses with the rapid Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score assisting in predicting overall prognosis with regards to mortality. Surgeons have an important role in ensuring adequate source control while recognizing the threat of carbapenem-resistance in gram-negative organisms. Rapid diagnostic tests are being used increasingly for the early identification of multi-drug-resistant organisms (MDROs), with a key emphasis on the multidisciplinary alert of results. Novel, higher generation antibiotic agents have been developed for resistance in ESKCAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) organisms while surgeons have an important role in the prevention of spread. The Study to Optimize Peritoneal Infection Therapy (STOP-IT) trial has challenged the previous paradigm of length of antibiotic treatment whereas biomarkers such as procalcitonin are playing a prominent role in individualizing therapy. Several novel therapies for refractory septic shock, while still investigational, are gaining prominence rapidly (such as vitamin C) whereas others await further clinical trials. Management strategies presented as care bundles continue to be updated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, yet still remain controversial in its global adoption. We have broadened our temporal and epidemiologic perspective of sepsis by understanding it both as an acute, time-sensitive, life-threatening illness to a chronic condition that increases the risk of mortality up to five years post-discharge. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and bedside scoring systems can assist the clinician in predicting post-operative sepsis. The public health role of the surgeon is key. This includes collaboration and multi-disciplinary antibiotic stewardship at a hospital level.

Recent advances in assessment and management have occurred since a comprehensive review of the care of patients with severe burns was last published, which may influence research and clinical practice. Recent Advances: Recent advances have occurred in the understanding of burn pathophysiology, which has led to the identification of potential biomarkers of burn severity, such as protein C. There is new evidence about the potential superiority of natural colloids over crystalloids during fluid resuscitation, and new evidence about components of initial and perioperative management, including an improved understanding of pain following burns. Critical Issues: The limitations of the clinical examination highlight the need for imaging and biomarkers to assist in estimations of burn severity. Fluid resuscitation reduces mortality, although there is conjecture over the ideal method. The subsequent perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and the evidence for preventing and treating pain, infection, and fluid overload while maximizing wound healing potential is described. Future Directions: Promising developments are ongoing in imaging technology, histopathology, biomarkers, and wound healing adjuncts such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy, topical negative pressure therapy, stem cell treatments, and skin substitutes.

Our aim was to compare the yearly prevalence, outcome and the Sepsis Six bundle compliance in patients at risk of mortality from sepsis in non-intensive care environments. Patients with a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of 3 or above and suspected or proven infection were enrolled into four yearly 24-h point prevalence studies, carried out in fourteen hospitals across Wales from 2016 to 2019. We followed up patients to 30 days between 2016-2019 and to 90 days between 2017 and 2019. Out of the 26,947 patients screened 1651 fulfilled inclusion criteria and were recruited. The full `Sepsis Six' care bundle was completed on 223 (14.0%) occasions, with no significant difference between the years. On 190 (11.5%) occasions none of the bundle elements were completed. There was no significant correlation between bundle element compliance, NEWS or year of study. One hundred and seventy (10.7%) patients were seen by critical care outreach; the `Sepsis Six' bundle was completed significantly more often in this group (54/170, 32.0%) than for patients who were not reviewed by critical care outreach (168/1385, 11.6%; p < 0.0001). Overall survival to 30 days was 81.7% (1349/1651), with a mean survival time of 26.5 days (95% CI 26.1-26.9) with no difference between each year of study. 90- day survival for years 2017-2019 was 74.7% (949/1271), with no difference between the years. In multivariate regression we identified older age, heart failure, recent chemotherapy, higher frailty score and do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation orders as significantly associated with increased 30-day mortality.

We report a specific spatial imaging abnormality on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that portends a poor prognosis: bilateral hippocampal hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. Methods: Eighty sequential comatose cardiac arrest patients underwent MRI scans. Qualitative and quantitative regional analyses were performed. Patients were categorized as HIPPO+ (n = 18) or HIPPO- (n = 62) based on whether they had bilateral hippocampal hyperintensities. Poor outcome was defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score >= 4 at 6 months. Results: Patients with bilateral hippocampal abnormalities had a higher frequency of poor outcome (P = .032). HIPPO+ patients suffered more severe cerebral injury, with lower whole brain apparent diffusion coefficient values (P = .043) and a greater number of affected regions on DWI (P = .001) and FLAIR (P = .001) than HIPPO- patients. The hippocampal approach was 100% specific for a poor prognosis; only 1 patient survived and remained in a vegetative state.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Predictive value of veno-arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure difference and central venous oxygen saturation for fluid administration and mortality in critically ill patients with extensive burns,"Objectives: Guiding fluid therapy in severely burned patients presents complex challenges, combining elements of both distributive and hypovolemic shock, accompanied by cardiovascular dysfunction. Whereas parts of hemodynamic assessment in septic shock such as central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) and the arterial-venous carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure difference (Delta pCO2 = pcvCO2 - paCO2) can both be used as indicators of hypoperfusion, they are not part of the standard clinical assessment of severely burned patients. The aim of this retrospective study was thus to investigate whether the Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 in severely burned patients correlates with fluid administration and mortality. Methods: Retrospective analysis of severely burned patients with burns larger than 20 % total body surface area (TBSA) admitted between 01/2017 and 06/2021 to the Burns Center of the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. Patients were treated according to international guidelines and in-house standards and Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 were assessed at least once within the first 24 h of intensive care unit admission. Results: In total 69 patients were included in this analysis. The median Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 were 1.16 kPa [inter-quartile range IQR, 0.82 - 1.50] and 76 % [IQR, 71 - 81]. This translated to an abnormally elevated Delta pCO2 (>0.8 kPa) in 53 (77 %) and an abnormally reduced ScvO2 (<70 %) in 13 (19 %) patients. Initial Delta pCO2, but not ScvO2, was non-linearly associated with intravenous fluid administration in the following 24 h (estimate(log) 9.6 L [95 % confidence interval CI, 4.1 - 15.2], p = 0.001) and 48 h (estimate(log) 6.0 L [95 % CI, 0.3 - 11.8], p = 0.039). Both initial Delta pCO2 (logarithmic odds ratio ORlog 4.3 [95 % CI, 1.1 - 20.9], p = 0.048) as well as ScvO2 (ORlog 0.1 [95 % CI, 0 - 0.42], p = 0.034) were non-linearly associated with in-hospital mortality. However, the best association with mortality was achieved by combining Delta pCO2 and ScvO2, with patients presenting with abnormalities in both Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 having a predicted mortality of 46 % [95 % CI, 23-71]. Conclusion: In severely burned patients, both Delta pCO2 and ScvO2 are associated with the extent and severity of burns as well as with in-hospital mortality. However, only Delta pCO2 seems to possess potential as a predictor of fluid administration. A multimodal approach to fluid resuscitation including both parameters may show promise in severely burned patients; however, further prospective studies are required to define optimal thresholds and validate its integration into clinical fluid resuscitation practice.",BURNS,2025,"Scherr, BF; Wendel-Garcia, PD; Bruns, H; Steiger, P; Schuepbach, RA; Kim, BS; Vasella, M; Camen, G; Buehler, PK",10.1016/j.burns.2025.107585,,WOS:001541495000002,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Ethical considerations in the use of RhD-positive blood products in trauma,"BackgroundPrehospital and early in-hospital use of low titer group O whole blood (LTOWB) for life-threatening bleeding has been independently associated with improved survival compared to component therapy. However, when RhD-positive blood products are administered to RhD-negative females of childbearing potential (FCP), there is a small future risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). This raises important ethical questions that must be explored in order to justify the use of RhD-positive blood products, including LTOWB, both in clinical practice and research. MethodsThis essay explores the ethical challenges related to RhD-positive blood product administration to RhD-negative or RhD-unknown FCPs as a first-line resuscitation fluid in the trauma setting. These ethical issues include: issues related to decision-making, ethical analysis based on the doctrine of double effect (DDE), and attendant obligations incurred by hospitals that administer RhD-positive blood to FCPs. ResultsEthical analysis through the use of the DDE demonstrates that utilization of RhD-positive blood products, including LTOWB, in the early resuscitation of FCPs is an ethically appropriate approach. By accepting the risk of HDFN, hospitals generate obligations to promote blood donation, evaluate for alloimmunization and counsel patients on the future risk of HDFN, and maintain an understanding of the ethical rationale for RhD-positive blood transfusion.",TRANSFUSION,2024,"Malone, JR",10.1111/trf.17787,,WOS:001185898800001,A

Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of two large children's hospitals and treated for sepsis from November 2013 to June 2017. Presentation, ED treatment, and outcomes, primarily time to first bolus and first parental antibiotic, were compared between those transported via EMS versus patients who were self-transported. Results: Of the 1813 children treated in the ED for sepsis, 1452 were self-transported and 361 were transported via EMS. The EMS group were more frequently male, of black race, and publicly insured than the self-transport group. The EMS group was more likely to have a critical triage category, receive initial care in the resuscitation suite (51.9 vs. 22%), have hypotension at ED presentation (14.4 vs. 5.4%), lactate >2.0 mmol/L (60.6 vs. 40.8%), vasoactive agents initiated in the ED (8.9 vs. 4.9%), and to be intubated in the ED (14.4 vs. 2.8%). The median time to first IV fluid bolus was faster in the EMS group (36 vs. 57 min). Using Cox LASSO to adjust for potential covariates, time to fluids remained faster for the EMS group (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.12, 1.42). Time to antibiotics, ICU LOS, 3-or 30-day mortality rates did not differ, yet median hospital LOS was significantly longer in those transported by EMS versus self-transported (6.5 vs. 5.3 days). Conclusions: Children with sepsis transported by EMS are a sicker population of children than those self transported on arrival and had longer hospital stays. EMS transport was associated with earlier in-hospital fluid resuscitation but no difference in time to first antibiotic.

This study evaluates the impact of specialized palliative care (SPC) on advance care planning (ACP) and patterns of end-of-life care for patients who died in the hospital.Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of medical records extracted from a clinical data warehouse, covering patients who died aged 0-24 in an academic tertiary children's hospital in South Korea. Participants were categorized into before (2011-2013; pre-period) and after (2017-2019; post-period) the introduction of an SPC service. Within the post-period, patients were further categorized into SPC recipients and non-recipients.Results We identified 274 and 205 patients in the pre-period and post-period, respectively. ACP was conducted more and earlier in the post-period than in the pre-period, and in patients who received palliative care than in those who did not. Patients who received SPC were likely to receive less mechanical ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation and more opioids. A multivariable regression model showed that earlier ACP was associated with not being an infant, receiving SPC, and having a neurological or neuromuscular disease.Conclusions SPC involvement was associated with more and earlier ACP and less intense end-of-life care for children and young adults who died in the hospital.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Development and evaluation of a virtual reality basic life support for undergraduate students in Thailand: a project by Mae Fah Luang University (MFU BLiS VR),"Background In traditional basic life support training for university students or the public, trainees practice simulations only once or twice during the course, potentially limiting their competence. In contrast, virtual reality allows trainees to independently study and practice as often as needed, enhancing their skills. This research and development project aimed to develop and evaluate a novel learning device, virtual reality basic life support for undergraduate students of Mae Fah Luang University (MFU BLiS VR).Methods This study employed a two-group, pre- and post-test design, involving seventy students (n = 35 in each group) from Mae Fah Luang University, Thailand. Data were collected from March 2022 to January 2023. The experimental group received the MFU BLiS VR, in addition to traditional teaching, while the control group received only traditional teaching. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon signed ranks test.Results ""MFU BLiS VR"" provided a learning experience in out-of-hospital basic life support for adult patients in four scenarios: (1) a person who was not breathing but had a pulse; (2) a person who was not breathing, had no pulse, and required defibrillation; (3) a person who was not breathing, had no pulse, and did not require defibrillation; and (4) a person with normal breathing and pulse but was unconscious. Each scenario was presented sequentially from scenario one to scenario four. The scenarios encompassed common and complex situations requiring prompt and effective bystander responses to save lives. The results revealed that the experimental group had a significantly shorter no-flow time compared to the control group (Z = -5.02, p < .001) and achieved significantly higher knowledge scores than the control group (Z = -3.39, p < .01) as well as superior practical skills (Z = -7.26, p < .001). Both groups reported the highest satisfaction levels in all aspects, with no significant differences.Conclusion MFU BLiS VR is an effective training approach for teaching and learning basic life support and the use of an automated electronic defibrillator.

N-6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), an A(1) adenosine receptor agonist, inhibits thermogenesis and induces onset of hibernation in hibernating species. Despite promising thermolytic efficacy of CHA, prior work has failed to achieve and maintain a prescribed target core body temperature (T-b) between 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 24 hours. We instrumented Sprague-Dawley rats (n=19) with indwelling arterial and venous cannulae and a transmitter for monitoring T-b and ECG, then administered CHA via continuous IV infusion or intraperitoneal (IP) injection. In the first experiment (n=11), we modulated ambient temperature and increased the dose of CHA in an attempt to manage T-b. In the second experiment (n=8), we administered CHA (0.25mg/[kg.h]) via continuous IV infusion and modulated cage surface temperature to control T-b. We rewarmed animals by increasing surface temperature at 1 degrees C h(-1) and discontinued CHA after T-b reached 36.5 degrees C. T-b, brain temperature (T-brain), heart rate, blood gas, and electrolytes were also monitored. Results show that titrating dose to adjust for individual variation in response to CHA led to tolerance and failed to manage a prescribed T-b. Starting with a dose (0.25mg/[kg.h]) and modulating surface temperature to prevent overcooling proved to be an effective means to achieve and maintain T-b between 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 24 hours. Increasing surface temperature to 37 degrees C during CHA administration brought T-b back to normothermic levels. All animals treated in this way rewarmed without incident. During the initiation of cooling, we observed bradycardia within 30 minutes of the start of IV infusion, transient hyperglycemia, and a mild hypercapnia; the latter normalized via metabolic compensation. In conclusion, we describe an intravenous delivery protocol for CHA at 0.25mg/(kg.h) that, when coupled with conductive cooling, achieves and maintains a prescribed and consistent target T-b between 32 degrees C and 34 degrees C for 24 hours.",THERAPEUTIC HYPOTHERMIA AND TEMPERATURE MANAGEMENT,2018,"Laughlin, BW; Bailey, IR; Rice, SA; Barati, Z; Bogren, LK; Drew, KL",10.1089/ther.2017.0020,,WOS:000426656300001,A

Despite historical underrecognition, emerging evidence demonstrates significant associations between chloremia disturbances and critical care outcomes. This paper aims to narratively review the pathophysiology, clinical features, and management strategies of chloremia disturbances in critically ill patients. Chloremia disturbances are common in ICU patients, with both hypochloremia (<96 mEq/L) and hyperchloremia (>106 mEq/L) independently associated with increased mortality, prolonged ICU length of stay, and organ dysfunction. In sepsis, chloride levels exhibit a prognostic value, with threshold effects around 105 mEq/L. Hyperchloremia particularly increases acute kidney injury risk, while hypochloremia correlates with prolonged mechanical ventilation. The choice of resuscitation fluids significantly influences clinical outcomes, with balanced crystalloids potentially reducing adverse events if compared to normal saline solutions. Recent large-scale trials demonstrate lower rates of major adverse kidney events with chloride-restrictive strategies. Optimal management requires careful patient monitoring along with acid-base assessment. Treatment approaches must identify underlying causes to avoid complications. Prevention strategies include protocol-based fluid therapy, medication selection consideration, and early intervention in high-risk patients.

It remains challenging to implement ERAS concepts in the acute trauma patient due to deranged physiological reserve from the penetrating or blunt trauma producing altered physiology. However, systems of care improve access to early intervention and potentially reduce mortality. These consensus guidelines examine optimal pre-hospital, resuscitation-room, intra- and post-operative treatment, systems of ethical management, and overall care for trauma patients in the post-resuscitation phase of care. The guideline is presented in three parts, this being part 3.MethodsExperts in aspects of management of trauma surgical patients and intensive care were invited to contribute by the International ERAS Society and IATSIC. Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE database searches on English language publications were performed for ERAS elements using the patient intervention comparator outcome (PICO) consensus questions created by the expert group. Studies were selected with particular attention to randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and large cohort studies; reviewed; and summarized recommendations were graded using the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) system. These recommendations based on current best evidence, with extrapolation from elective patient studies where appropriate, were followed by a modified two-round Delphi method to validate final recommendations. Several ERAS components are already standard of care within national and society guidelines and are endorsed. The bulk of the text focuses on key areas pertaining specifically to trauma care of major trauma and polytrauma in the ICU-requiring group.ResultsOverall 37 aspects of trauma care were considered with multiple PICO questions and sub-points. Consensus was reached after two rounds of a modified Delphi process involving all authors, with minor adjustments to some phrasing required but with 87% overall agreement on all statements (100% agreement on 31 of the main statement sets, prior to minor edits to address the points of difference for the rest with 100% total agreement thereafter). None were rejected outright. The recommendations and level of evidence for each aspect of trauma care that may impact on improved recovery and reduced length of hospital stay are presented with grade of recommendation.ConclusionsFour main areas of relevance to ethics and systems are presented as part 3. The guidelines are based on current best evidence for an ERAS approach to patients who have had major injuries and polytrauma. These guidelines are not exhaustive but collate the best available evidence on important components of care for this patient population.

Study design and rationa le of two prospective clinical studies,"Background: ECG-less coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a novel and promising tool for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Compared to conventional ECG-gated CCTA, it is less dependent on heart rate control and gives the possibility of ruling out both pulmonary embolism and CAD using a single contrast injection. Recently, it has shown good sensitivity in detecting obstructive CAD. Given the limitations of current emergency room algorithms-primarily based on clinical presentation, ECG, and biomarkers-the triage of patients with acute chest pain or cardiac arrest may benefit from this emerging imaging modality. Methods: We designed two prospective, single-center, double-blinded clinical studies to investigate the role of ECG-less CCTA in acute scenarios. The ECLECTIC study (ECG-LEss coronary Computed Tomography angiography in the management of patients presenting with hIgh-troponin and Chest pain, NCT07192965) will evaluate diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value in patients presenting with acute chest pain, mildly elevated troponin levels, and a high clinical suspicion of CAD. The OPEN-CCT Arrest (Optimizing Post-arrest Evaluation with Non-gated Cardiac CT) will assess the feasibility and diagnostic utility of this technique in cardiac arrest survivors. In both studies, patients will undergo ECG-less CCTA followed by ICA, considered the gold standard. Clinical implications: ECG-less CCTA pushes the boundaries of using CCTA in acute clinical scenarios. This technique may reduce preparation time and improve workflow, especially in highly instrumented patients. If its diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value are proven, ECG-less CCTA could significantly decrease the need for unnecessary invasive procedures, the length of hospital stay, and the overall healthcare costs.",CARDIOVASCULAR REVASCULARIZATION MEDICINE,2026,"Giangiacomi, F; Popelier, B; Lochy, S; Nieboer, K; Von Kemp, M; Belsack, D; Tanaka, K; Cosyns, B; Argacha, JF; De Mey, J",10.1016/j.carrev.2025.11.009,,WOS:001676911900001,A

This intervention's feasibility needs testing in psychologically distressed cardiac patients for whom heart-related anxiety is a core concern. To enhance scalability and convenience, remote delivery of HRVB also needs to be assessed. Accordingly, we evaluated the feasibility of remote HRVB in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA) with elevated CA-related psychological distress. Methods: The intervention was comprised of daily sessions of diaphragmatic paced breathing and real-time monitoring of cardiac activity guided by a smartphone app and heart rate monitor. This single-arm feasibility trial assessed the percentage of eligible contacted patients who consented and engaged in the study and the selfreported acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and usability of the intervention. Exploratory analyses assessed pre-to-post changes in trait anxiety, negative affect, cardiac-related interoceptive fear, and resting-state HRV. Results: Of 12 eligible CA survivors contacted, 10 enrolled. All 10 patients completed the virtual study visits and the majority (>50 %) of prescribed training sessions. Ninety percent reported good scores for intervention acceptability and feasibility, and 80 % reported good scores for its appropriateness and usability for reducing fear. Trait anxiety decreased significantly pre-to-post intervention. There were no changes in negative affect, interoceptive fear, or resting state HRV. Conclusion: A remotely delivered HRVB intervention was acceptable, feasible, and useable for cardiac patients with CA-related psychological distress.

In the presence of standard or usual care, the prevailing mortality was over 40-50 %. In response, a systems-based approach, similar to that in acute myocardial infarction, stroke and trauma, called early goal-directed therapy was compared to standard care and this clinical trial resulted in a significant mortality reduction. Since the publication of that trial, similar outcome benefits have been reported in over 70 observational and randomized controlled studies comprising over 70,000 patients. As a result, early goal-directed therapy was largely incorporated into the first 6 hours of sepsis management (resuscitation bundle) adopted by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and disseminated internationally as the standard of care for early sepsis management. Recently a trio of trials (ProCESS, ARISE, and ProMISe), while reporting an all-time low sepsis mortality, question the continued need for all of the elements of early goal-directed therapy or the need for protocolized care for patients with severe and septic shock.

It lowers mortality and improved cardiovascular outcome compared to con-servative therapy including thrombolysis. Reperfusion injury, which occurs after successful re-opening of the formerly occluded coronary artery, had been exploited as a potential therapeutic target. When revasculariza-tion became faster and primary percutaneous coro-nary intervention was successfully performed within 60-90 minutes of symptom onset, the interest in a potential additive effect of targeting reperfusion injury vanished. More recently, several meta-analyses indi-cated that limiting reperfusion injury prevents micro -vascular obstruction and reduces final infarct size, thereby lowering the probability of heart failure events and improving quality of life in AMI survivors. Here, we describe the current strategies to limit reperfusion injury and to improve post-AMI outcomes such as systemic or intracoronary hypothermia, left -ventricular unloading, intracoronary infusion of super-saturated oxygen, intermittent coronary sinus occlusion, and C-reactive protein apheresis.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,The lactate to albumin ratio linked to all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with septic myocardial injury,"Background The lactate to albumin ratio (LAR) has emerged as a promising prognostic marker in critically ill patients. Despite its potential utility, the prognostic value of LAR in septic myocardial injury (SMI) remains uncertain.Methods This study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of LAR in SMI through a retrospective cohort analysis of data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) (v1.4) database. The study included intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients (age >= 18 years) diagnosed with SMI. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.Results A total of 704 patients were included in the study, of which 59.10% were male. Hospital mortality and ICU mortality rates were recorded at 29.97% and 22.87%, respectively. After adjusting for confounding factors, multivariate Cox proportional risk analysis demonstrated that LAR was independently associated with an increased risk of both hospital mortality (HR, 1.39 [95% CI: 1.24-1.56] P < 0.001) and ICU mortality (HR, 1.46 [95% CI: 1.29-1.65] P < 0.001). Furthermore, the generalized additive model (GAM) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) model indicated a linear relationship between LAR and mortality rates in the ICU and hospital.Conclusions The LAR may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker in critically ill patients with SMI. High LAR levels are associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality and can help identify individuals with high mortality rates.

Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Cochrane were searched for relevant articles published through April 13th, 2023. Studies assessing the utilization of DPR in adult DCS patients were included. Outcomes included time to abdominal closure, intra-abdominal complications, in-hospital mortality, and ICU length of stay (ICU LOS). Results: Five studies evaluating 437 patients were included. In patients with hemorrhagic shock, DPR was associated with reduced time to abdominal closure (DPR 4.1 days, control 5.9 days, p = 0.002), intra-abdominal complications including abscess formation (DPR 27 %, control 47 %, p = 0.04), and ICU LOS (DPR 8 days, control 11 days, p = 0.004). Findings in patients without hemorrhagic shock were conflicting. Closure times were decreased in one study (DPR 5.9 days, control 7.7 days, p < 0.02) and increased in another study (DPR 3.5 days, control 2.5 days, p = 0.02), intra-abdominal complications were decreased in one study (DPR 27 %, control 47 %, p = 0.04) and similar in another, and ICU LOS was decreased in one study (DPR 17 days, control 24 days, p < 0.002) and increased in another (DPR 13 days, control 11.4 days, p = 0.807).

Studies have shown that when TBI is complicated by HS (TBI + HS), the mortality rate of patients increases significantly due to their complex pathophysiological interactions. Early and precise mortality risk assessment is essential for identifying high-risk TBI + HS patients, allocating healthcare resources, and implementing early treatments to improve clinical outcomes. This study proposes STran-TM, a novel mortality prediction framework designed to enhance prognostic accuracy in TBI + HS patients. STran-TM introduces two key innovations: the incorporation of missing-label variables to extract latent clinical semantics from missing data patterns, and the application of self-supervised learning (SSL) to pre-train a feature extractor for vital sign temporal representations. Using clinical data from the first 12 h after TBI + HS diagnosis, STran-TM predicts 48hour, 7-day, and in-hospital mortality. A total of 272 and 181 TBI + HS patients were selected from the MIMIC-IV and eICU databases, respectively. The model was trained and internally validated on MIMIC-IV, and externally validated on eICU. STran-TM achieved excellent predictive performance for 48-hour mortality (AUC: 0.9530 on MIMIC-IV, 0.8722 on eICU) and 7-day mortality (AUC: 0.8831 on MIMIC-IV, 0.8938 on eICU). Although performance slightly declined for in-hospital mortality (AUC: 0.8314 on MIMIC-IV, 0.8430 on eICU), the model maintained high reliability. By integrating missing-label variables and leveraging SSL, STran-TM enhances predictive performance and demonstrates robust generalizability across databases, offering a promising tool for early risk stratification in TBI + HS patients.",BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL,2026,"Xu, XY; Chang, PP; Liu, GJ; Feng, J; Wen, JH; Chen, XY; Zhang, G",10.1016/j.bspc.2026.109471,,WOS:001666339900001,A

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Correcting for case-mix shift when developing clinical prediction models,"BackgroundWhen developing a clinical prediction model (CPM), a case-mix shift could occur in the development dataset where the distribution of individual predictors changes, potentially affecting model performance. This study exploits the case-mix shift that is already observed in the development dataset to address the case-mix shift between the development and deployment phase of a CPM.MethodsWe propose a Membership-based method to correct for case-mix shift in the development phase of CPMs. This method uses a probabilistic similarity metric to re-weight data samples in the source set (before the case-mix shift) to more closely match the target set (after the case-mix shift), assuming the target set reflects the target population. We apply the proposed method in a real-world dataset of myocardial infarction patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest within 90 days as the outcome. We design nine scenarios (including case-mix shift and no case-mix shift with a range of target/source sets sample sizes) to explore the impact on predictive performance of CPM developed with the proposed method in comparison to CPMs developed by either using all data samples but ignore the shift, or only using the most recent data. We report calibration and discrimination on development and 200 bootstrap samples.Results and ConclusionsThe proposed method shows promise in accounting for case-mix shift when developing a CPM, particularly when the target set sample size is insufficient. In a partial case-mix shift scenario with an insufficient target sample size, the Membership-based model achieved an optimism-adjusted calibration slope (c-slope) of 0.98, outperforming other models. Conversely, when the target set sample size is sufficient, the Unweighted model on target data only had an optimism-adjusted c-slope of 0.95, compared to 0.92 for the Membership-based model. In complete case-mix shift cases, the Membership-based and Unweighted on target data only models performed similarly. Both achieved an optimism-adjusted c-slope of 0.77 with insufficient target sample size, and optimism-adjusted c-slope of 0.94 with a sufficient target sample size. Further investigation and testing are needed, as well as accounting for other types of data distribution shift to improve model fit for the latest distribution shift in the development dataset.",BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY,2025,"Elayan, H; Sperrin, M; Martin, GP; Peek, N; Braunschweig, F; Faxén, J; Alfredsson, J; Jenkins, DA",10.1186/s12874-025-02621-2,,WOS:001541743400003,A

Until now, left ventricular ejection fraction has been used as a key criterion for selecting patients with DCM for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for primary prevention purposes. However, registry data suggest that many patients with DCM and an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not have a markedly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, many patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction die of nonsudden causes of death. Methods to predict a higher or lower risk of sudden death include the detection of myocardial fibrosis (a substrate for ventricular arrhythmia), microvolt T-wave alternans (a marker of electrophysiological vulnerability), and genetic testing. Midwall fibrosis is identified by late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in approximate to 30% of patients and provides incremental value in addition to left ventricular ejection fraction for the prediction of sudden cardiac death events. Microvolt T-wave alternans represents another promising predictor, supported by large meta-analyses that have highlighted the negative predictive value of this test. However, neither of these strategies have been routinely adopted for risk stratification in clinical practice. More convincing data from randomized trials are required to inform the management of patients with these features. Understanding of the genetics of DCM and how specific mutations affect arrhythmic risk is also rapidly increasing. The finding of a mutation in lamin A/C, the cause of approximate to 6% of idiopathic DCM, commonly underpins more aggressive management because of the malignant nature of the associated phenotype. With the expansion of genetic sequencing, the identification of further high-risk mutations appears likely, leading to better-informed clinical decision making and providing insight into disease mechanisms. Over the next 5 to 10 years, we expect these techniques to be integrated into the existing algorithm to form a more sensitive, specific, and cost-effective approach to the selection of patients with DCM for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation.",CIRCULATION,2017,"Halliday, BP; Cleland, JGF; Goldberger, JJ; Prasad, SK",10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.116.027134,,WOS:000405090000011,A

The aims are to reduce variation caused by discontinuity of care; avoid harms caused by inappropriate treatment and promote patients' priorities and preferences. The TEP is based on the goals of treatment - 'What are we trying to achieve?' The goals take account of the context of acute illness, the consequences of interventions and discussion with the patient. They should reflect a shift away from 'fix-it' medicine to what is realistic and pragmatic. A TEP has three escalation categories: full escalation, selected appropriate treatments and palliative/supportive care. Other appropriate/inappropriate treatments are also recorded. Treatment Escalation Plans are associated with significant reductions in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, non-beneficial interventions, harms and complaints.

Recognition and treatment of maternal sepsis are often delayed due to the physiological adaptations of pregnancy and vague or absent signs and symptoms during its initial presentation. Over the past decade, our understanding of sepsis has evolved and maternal early warning systems have been developed in an effort to help providers promptly identify and stratify parturients who are at risk. In addition, new consensus definitions and care bundles have recently been published by the World Health Organization and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign to facilitate earlier recognition and timely management of sepsis. In this narrative review, we summarize the available evidence about sepsis and provide an overview of the research efforts focused on maternal sepsis to date.

In this study, we evaluated sepsis management strategies and their impact on clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted by analyzing clinical and treatment data from the electronic records of sepsis patients who had been admitted to tertiary care hospitals in eastern Saudi Arabia. Using systematic sampling, the details of eligible patients were obtained. Data were collected on patient demographics, vital signs, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and laboratory parameters, treatment (antibiotic therapy, vasopressor use, or fluid resuscitation), and outcomes (survival in hospital). Statistical analyses were performed to assess the association between clinical and treatment strategies and patient outcomes. Results: A total of 234 sepsis cases were analyzed, of which 70.9% were survivors and 29.1% were non-survivors. Patients aged 60 years and above were the most affected. Statistically significant differences were observed across all of the measured vital sign variables and outcomes (p < 0.0001). Based on SOFA scores, 56.41% of patients were assessed as having a moderate risk. Through our comparison of clinical and laboratory parameters between survivors and non-survivors, significant differences were found in all of the measured variables (p < 0.0001). The odds of survival were significantly higher in those who received early administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (OR = 4.9449, p = 0.0001), vasopressor therapy (OR = 1.9408, p = 0.0262), and fluid resuscitation OR = 11.035, p = 0.0001).

At the clinical level, it has been shown to improve outcomes in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and in neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, but has yet to be convincingly demonstrated in stroke. While numerous preclinical studies have shown benefit in stroke models, translating this to the clinical level has proven challenging. Major obstacles include cooling patients with typical stroke who are awake and breathing spontaneously but often have significant comorbidities. Solutions around these problems include selective brain cooling and cooling to lesser depths or avoiding hyperthermia. This review will cover the mechanisms of protection by therapeutic hypothermia, as well as recent progress made in selective brain cooling and the neuroprotective effects of only slightly lowering brain temperature. Therapeutic hypothermia for stroke has been shown to be feasible, but has yet to be definitively proven effective.

The most prevalent and problematic of these conditions involves survivors of cardiac arrest who are initially in coma with intact brainstem reflexes. In such patients single EEGs are of 100% specificity for no possibility of recovery of consciousness only for essentially complete generalized suppression (<10 <mu>V) after the first day of the arrest. Several other generalized patterns, including less marked suppression, burst-suppression, epileptiform activity, periodic complexes, and alpha-Theta coma patterns, usually but not invariably indicate a poor outcome.

Automated EEG analysis may help quantify the brain damage. Forty-six comatose patients in therapeutic hypothermia, after cardiac arrest, were included in the study. EEG background was quantified with burst-suppression ratio (BSR) and approximate entropy, both used to monitor anesthesia. Reactivity was detected through change in the power spectrum of signal before and after stimulation. Automatic results obtained almost perfect agreement (discontinuity) to substantial agreement (background reactivity) with a visual score from EEG-certified neurologists. Burst-suppression ratio was more suited to distinguish continuous EEG background from burst-suppression than approximate entropy in this specific population.

Traditional scoring systems often fail to account for dynamic physiological changes occurring during ED stays. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising alternative by integrating comprehensive patient data for enhanced predictive capabilities.<br /> Objective This study aimed to develop and validate an ML-based early warning system to predict adverse events, including cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit (ICU) transfer, within 48 h of hospitalization.<br /> Methods This retrospective multicenter study included data from 169,807 patients across two medical centers to train ML models for predicting adverse events occurring within 48 h of hospitalization. The prediction time origin (T0) was the moment of hospital admission. All ED data obtained before T0 were included as model input, and adverse events were defined as those occurring within 48 h after T0. Three machine learning models were trained and evaluated: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB).The ML models were evaluated in external test cohorts with 54,515 patients from a regional teaching hospital. Model performance was assessed against traditional early warning scores, including the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and Modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (mSOFA) using the area under the curve (AUC).<br /> Results In the internal test set, XGB achieved the highest AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.85-0.89), followed by RF 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.87) and LR 0.83 (95% CI: 0.81-0.85), outperforming NEWS (AUC 0.71), MEWS (0.69), and mSOFA (0.69). In the external test set, XGB maintained the best discrimination (AUC 0.82, 95% CI: 0.80-0.83), followed by RF 0.78 (95% CI: 0.77-0.80) and LR 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.79), again exceeding NEWS (0.67), MEWS (0.65), and mSOFA (0.69).

The role of pelvic exsanguination in causing hemorrhagic shock is unclear, as associated injuries frequently accompany pelvic fractures. This study aims to compare the incidence of hemorrhagic shock and in-hospital outcomes in patients with isolated and non-isolated pelvic fractures. Methods Registries-based study of trauma patients hospitalized following pelvic fractures. Data from 1997 to 2021 were cross-referenced between the Israel Defense Forces Trauma Registry (IDF-TR), documenting prehospital care, and Israel National Trauma Registry (INTR) recording hospitalization data. Patients with isolated pelvic fractures were defined as having an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) <3 in other anatomical regions, and compared with patients sustaining pelvic fracture and at least one associated injury (AIS >= 3). Signs of profound shock upon emergency department (ED) arrival were defined as either a systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and/or a heart rate >130 beats per min. Results Overall, 244 hospitalized trauma patients with pelvic fractures were included, most of whom were males (84.4%) with a median age of 21 years. The most common injury mechanisms were motor vehicle collisions (64.8%), falls from height (13.1%) and gunshot wounds (11.5%). Of these, 68 (27.9%) patients sustained isolated pelvic fractures. In patients with non-isolated fractures, the most common regions with a severe associated injury were the thorax and abdomen. Signs of shock were recorded for 50 (20.5%) patients upon ED arrival, but only four of these had isolated pelvic fractures. In-hospital mortality occurred among 18 (7.4%) patients, all with non-isolated fractures.

The aim of this prospective, observational, multicenter cohort study is to determine the risk factors for mortality in elderly and very elderly critically ill patients with sepsis.ResultsA total of 1490 patients with 65years of age were included in the study; most of them 1231 (82.6%) had a cardiovascular failure. The mean age (SD) was 74.5 (+/- 5.6)years, and 876 (58.8%) were male. The patients were divided into two cohorts: (1) elderly: 65-79years and (2) very elderly: 80years. The overall hospital mortality was 48.8% (n=727) and was significantly higher in very elderly compared to elderly patients (54.2% vs. 47.4%; p=0.02). Factors independently associated with mortality were APACHE II score of the disease, patient location at sepsis diagnosis, development of acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia in the group of elderly patients. On the other hand, in the group of very elderly patients, predictors of hospital mortality were age, APACHE II score, and prompt adherence of the resuscitation bundle.Conclusion This prospective multicenter study found that patients aged 80 or over had higher hospital mortality compared to patients between 65 and 79years.

Prior guidelines for paediatric septic shock demonstrated varying levels of effectiveness. In 2017, the institutional paediatric septic shock guidelines were established, emphasizing three pivotal components: prompt recognition, early and appropriate resuscitation, and organ support with intensive stabilization. Herein, we aimed to assess the effect of paediatric septic shock guidelines on mortality and clinical outcomes. This single-centre retrospective cohort study investigating the pre- and postimplementation of paediatric septic shock guidelines was conducted in patients aged 1 month to 15 years diagnosed with septic shock from January 2014 to December 2022. The effectiveness of the guideline implementation was evaluated through propensity matching analysis to compare 30-day in-hospital mortality rates. Adherence to key components of the guidelines was also assessed. In total, 71 and 106 paediatric patients with septic shock were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit during the pre- and postguideline periods, respectively.

Unlike patients on hemodialysis (HD), pharmacokinetic data and dosing recom-mendations for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) are scant. Case report: A 2-year-old girl with end-stage kidney disease undergoing PD suffered prolonged focal onset sei-zures. The patient had congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract associated with branchio-oto-renal syndrome due to an EYA1 gene mutation. She also had neurological sequelae from post-resuscitation encepha-lopathy at the age of one month. Antiseizure medication with few drug interactions, less impact on the neuro-developmental state and possibility of intravenous administration was preferred. LCM met those criteria and was carefully administered. Although the patient had recurrent prolonged seizures during the titration periods, LCM could be continued without any apparent side effects. The blood levels of LCM increased linearly to the optimal level. We confirmed excretion of LCM in the PD fluid.

The majority of patients were admitted to a community hospital and transferred later to the neurosurgical clinic. The data included mechanism of injury and clinical status at admission, including the level of consciousness according to the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) before and after resuscitation. After admission, nearly all patients below a score of 8 were intubated and treated with controlled ventilation until the patient awakened, died, or had remained in a steady state for similar to 3 weeks. Assessment of the final outcome was made according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) both at discharge and again after the patient's status was stabilized. The results show a stable yearly outcome during the 21 years of recording but a significantly improved good recovery and mortality rate when compared with our previous results. Outcome was significantly correlated to age and type and severity of lesion, as judged by the postresuscitation GCS. The outcome of the 1264 most severely injured, comatose patients (GCS < 9) shows a good recovery rate of 55%, a severely disabled rate of 14%, a vegetative rate of 7%, and a mortality rate of 24%.

However a small, but significant, number of deteriorating children experience suboptimal outcomes because of a failure to recognise and respond to acute deterioration early enough leading to unintended harm. Tragically this occasionally can have fatal consequences. Investigations into these rare events highlight common themes of missed early signs of deterioration in children, prompting regulatory agencies to suggest paediatric early warning systems (PEWS) to aid clinical practice. In England, track and trigger tools (TTT), which are one facet of PEWS have been widely rolled out but in a heterogeneous fashion. The evidence for TTT is mixed but they are complex interventions and current outcomes do not fully define the entirety of their potential impact.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Extravascular lung water in critical care: recent advances and clinical applications,"Extravascular lung water (EVLW) is the amount of fluid that is accumulated in the interstitial and alveolar spaces. In lung oedema, EVLW increases either because of increased lung permeability or because of increased hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries, or both. Increased EVLW is always potentially life-threatening, mainly because it impairs gas exchange and reduces lung compliance. The only technique that provides an easy measurement of EVLW at the bedside is transpulmonary thermodilution. The validation of EVLW measurements by thermodilution was based on studies showing reasonable correlations with gravimetry or thermo-dye dilution in experimental and clinical studies. EVLW should be indexed to predicted body weight. This indexation reduces the proportion of ARDS patients for whom EVLW is in the normal range. Compared to non-indexed EVLW, indexed EVLW (EVLWI) is better correlated with the lung injury score and the oxygenation and it is a better predictor of mortality of patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Transpulmonary thermodilution also provides the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI), which is an indirect reflection of the integrity of the alveolocapillary barrier. As clinical applications, EVLWI and PVPI may be useful to guide fluid management of patients at risk of fluid overload, as during septic shock and ARDS. High EVLWI and PVPI values predict mortality in several categories of critically ill patients, especially during ARDS. Thus, fluid administration should be limited when EVLWI is already high. Whatever the value of EVLWI, PVPI may indicate that fluid administration is particularly at risk of aggravating lung oedema. In the acute phase of haemodynamic resuscitation during septic shock and ARDS, high EVLWI and PVPI values may warn of the risk of fluid overload and prevent excessive volume expansion. At the post-resuscitation phase, they may prompt initiation of fluid removal thereby achieving a negative fluid balance.",ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE,2015,"Jozwiak, M; Teboul, JL; Monnet, X",10.1186/s13613-015-0081-9,,WOS:000367392900001,A

Since pharmacological therapy often does not completely suppress these arrhythmias, surgical procedures have been developed to provide an alternative mode of therapy. Coronary artery revascularization in patients with ischemic heart disease is associated with decreased sudden death mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who have no history of prior cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia. In sudden death survivors, coronary revascularization appears effective chiefly for patients without inducible ventricular tachycardia or with inducible ventricular fibrillation. Cardiac arrest survivors with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at electrophysiological study require an ablative procedure that is usually guided by electrophysiological mapping. Current technique should permit elective operations to be carried out with a less than 10% mortality and a greater than 85% rate for suppressing ventricular tachycardia. Nonsurgical catheter ablation techniques have already shown promise in patients with slower, well-tolerated tachycardias that allow extensive catheter mapping.

Most of the literature has emphasized the need for early surgical intervention. This is problematic for patients being treated at a facility lacking surgical support, with concerns for increasing mortality and morbidity rates. Methods This is a 10-year retrospective study of emergency department (ED) documentation and surgical operative reports of patients seen at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020. The patients were divided into two groups: the Transfer Group (TG), consisting of those transferred from another facility, and the Direct Admit Group (DAG), comprising those who presented directly to the ED. A comparison was conducted to identify statistically significant differences between the 2 groups of patients with a final diagnosis of NF, with specific emphasis on mortality rate, hospital length of stay (LOS), and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS. Results A total of 134 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NF were included in the final analysis. More than half (50.8%, n = 68) of the patients presented as transfers from area hospitals. Compared to the DAG, the TG had a significantly higher percentage of patients undergoing surgical intervention within six hours of ED presentation (95.6% vs. 10.6%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The TG had a lower mortality rate compared to the DAG (11.8% vs. 22.7%), though the difference did not reach statistical significance.

Previous clinical trials have shown benefits with balanced transfusion ratios in trauma resuscitation in adults, but smaller retrospective studies have not established the same in pediatrics. We constructed a pediatric trauma database at a Level I trauma center for analysis. METHODS The institutional trauma registry was queried for all pediatric trauma activations from 2008 to 2018. Patient identifiers were used to identify laboratory data from the electronic data warehouse. RESULTS There were 2,769 pediatric patients with trauma identified, with 1,492 arriving direct from the scene. Of those with complete transport data available, 81% arrived within 60 minutes from time of injury. Fifty-two patients were transfused in the first 24 hours, with 25 receiving greater than an estimated 40 mL/kg of blood products. No significant difference in ratios of red cell to plasma transfused at 24 hours was observed between patients surviving to discharge (1.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.6) and deceased (1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-1.9) (p= 0.087).

Recent technical advancements have prompted renewed interest in the Ross operation, particularly as an alternative to conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine national utilization of the Ross procedure over the last decade and evaluate associated feasibility, safety, and cost, relative to SAVR. Methods We identified adult and pediatric patients undergoing elective aortic valve replacement within the 2010-2022 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Ross and SAVR patients were age-matched using coarsened exact matching. Subsequently, multivariable regression was used to compare clinical outcomes, 30-day readmissions, and resource utilization between groups. The primary endpoint was a composite of in-hospital mortality, stroke, prolonged mechanical ventilation, reoperation, acute kidney injury, sepsis, cardiac arrest, and venous thromboembolism. Results Among 109,235 valve replacements, Ross procedures constituted 1.5% of adult and 37.2% of pediatric cases. Utilization increased significantly over time across age groups (P < 0.001). Compared to SAVR, Ross recipients were younger, with fewer comorbidities, and often treated at high-volume teaching hospitals. After age-matching and risk adjustment, the Ross approach was associated with lower odds of composite complications (adjusted OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.46-0.91), particularly stroke (adjusted OR: 0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.80), as well as lower nonhome discharge and 30-day readmissions.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Which Biomarkers Can Be Used as Diagnostic Tools for Infection in Suspected Sepsis?,"The diagnosis of infection in patients with suspected sepsis is frequently difficult to achieve with a reasonable degree of certainty. Currently, the diagnosis of infection still relies on a combination of systemic manifestations, manifestations of organ dysfunction, and microbiological documentation. In addition, the microbiologic confirmation of infection is obtained only after 2 to 3 days of empiric antibiotic therapy. These criteria are far from perfect being at least in part responsible for the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, in the community and in hospital, and probably the main drive for antibiotic resistance. Biomarkers have been studied and used in several clinical settings as surrogate markers of infection to improve their diagnostic accuracy as well as in the assessment of response to antibiotics and in antibiotic stewardship programs. The aim of this review is to provide a clear overview of the current evidence of usefulness of biomarkers in several clinical scenarios, namely, to diagnose infection to prescribe antibiotics, to exclude infection to withhold antibiotics, and to identify the causative pathogen to target antimicrobial treatment. In recent years, new evidence with ""old"" biomarkers, like C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, as well as new biomarkers and molecular tests, as breathomics or bacterial DNA identification by polymerase chain reaction, increased markedly in different areas adding useful information for clinical decision making at the bedside when adequately used. The recent evidence shows that the information given by biomarkers can support the suspicion of infection and pathogen identification but also, and not less important, can exclude its diagnosis.

NEWS was the most accurate predictor (area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC] curve 0.904 [95% CI 0.805-0.913]), followed by NEWS2 (AUROC 0.901). NEWS was also well calibrated. In patients judged at low risk (NEWS < 2), 359 events occurred (18.5% of the total). Neural network analysis revealed that age, systolic BP, and temperature had the highest relative weight for these NEWS-unpredicted events.Conclusions: NEWS is the most accurate EWS for predicting the risk of death/ICU admission within 24 h from ED arrival. The score also had a fair calibration with few events occurring in patients classified at low risk.

We aim to compare cardiovascular complications due to COVID-19, influenza and RSV. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional data from hospitalized children and young adults (<= 20 years) from 2020 and 2021 using National Inpatient Sample (NIS). We included individuals hospitalized for COVID-19, RSV, and influenza, and weighted data were used to compare cardiovascular complications. Results Of 212,655 respiratory virus admissions, 85,055 were from COVID-19, 103,185 were from RSV, and 24,415 were from influenza. Myocarditis was higher in COVID-19 [0.9%, n = 740] as compared to influenza [0.2%, n = 55] and RSV [0.1%, n = 65]. In the adjusted logistic regression, the odds of myocarditis was 61% lower in influenza [aOR = 0.39 (0.20-0.76), P = 0.006], and 85% lower in RSV [aOR = 0.15 (0.07-0.34) P < 0.001] as compared to COVID-19. Bradyarrhythmias/heart block was higher in COVID-19 [0.8%, n = 690] versus influenza [0.5%, n = 110] and RSV [0.2%, n = 205]. After adjusting for confounders for bradyarrhythmias/heart block, compared to COVID-19, the odds were 49% lower in RSV [aOR = 0.51 (0.33-0.80), P = 0.004] but no statistically significant difference in influenza [aOR = 0.79 (0.48-1.31), P = 0.374] was seen. Tachyarrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, and in-hospital mortality showed no differences after adjusting for covariates.

The concept of a successful outcome for an ICU patient has gone through meaningful maturation in the last decade. Not too long ago, for clinical trials in critical care, being alive at 28 days or alive and off the ventilator were the sole endpoints. Examination of ICU processes of care has led to longer periods of observation to determine survival endpoints. Recently, critical care experts also have focused on management factors that may affect survivors' quality of life. Many investigators have become interested in aspects of ICU practice that may affect the speed with which a person may return to premorbid function [7,8].

Response to oxygen treatment is unpredictable and the optimum concentration of oxygen in neonatal resuscitation is still a matter of debate among neonatologists. A metabolomic approach was used to characterize the metabolic profiles of newborn hypoxic-reoxygenated piglets. Urine samples were collected from newborn piglets (n = 40) undergoing hypoxia followed by resuscitation at different oxygen concentrations (ranging from 18% to 100%) and analyzed by <SU1</SUH NMR spectroscopy. Despite reoxygenation 7 piglets, out of 10 which became asystolic, did not respond to resuscitation. Profiles of the <SU1</SUH NMR spectra were submitted to unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (partial least squares-discriminant analysis) multivariate analysis. The supervised analyses showed differences in the metabolic profile of the urine collected before the induction of hypoxia between survivors and deaths. Metabolic variations were observed in the urine of piglets treated with different oxygen concentrations comparing T0 (basal value) and end of the experiment (resuscitation). Some of the individual metabolites discriminating between these groups were urea, creatinine, malonate, methylguanidine, hydroxyisobutyric acid. The metabolomic approach appears a promising tool for investigating newborn hypoxia over time, for monitoring the response to the treatment with different oxygen concentrations, and might lead to a tailored management of the disorder.</.",JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE,2010,"Atzori, L; Xanthos, T; Barberini, L; Antonucci, R; Murgia, F; Lussu, M; Aroni, F; Varsami, M; Papalois, A; Lai, A; D'Aloja, E; Iacovidou, N; Fanos, V",10.3109/14767058.2010.517033,,WOS:000282588900038,A

Currently, visual interpretation of electroencephalogram (EEG) is one of the main modality used in outcome prediction. There is a growing interest in computer-assisted EEG interpretation, either to overcome the possible subjectivity of visual interpretation, or to identify complex features of the EEG signal. We used a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict functional outcome based on 19-channel-EEG recorded from 267 adult comatose patients during targeted temperature management after CA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on the test set was 0.885. Interestingly, model architecture and fine-tuning only played a marginal role in classification performance. We then used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) as visualization technique to identify which EEG features were used by the network to classify an EEG epoch as favorable or unfavorable outcome, and also to understand failures of the network. Grad-CAM showed that the network relied on similar features than classical visual analysis for predicting unfavorable outcome (suppressed background, epileptiform transients). This study confirms that CNNs are promising models for EEG-based prognostication in comatose patients, and that Grad-CAM can provide explanation for the models' decision-making, which is of utmost importance for future use of deep learning models in a clinical setting.",HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING,2019,"Jonas, S; Rossetti, AO; Oddo, M; Jenni, S; Favaro, P; Zubler, F",10.1002/hbm.24724,,WOS:000478116100001,A

Early warning scores (EWS) help detect acutely ill patients who are seriously ill and likely to deteriorate. However, it is not known if any EWS has universal applicability to all patient populations. The benefit of Rapid Response Systems (RRS) such as Medical Emergency Teams has yet to be proven, possibly because doctors and nurses are reluctant to call the RRS for help. Reconfiguration of care delivery in an Acute Medical Assessment Unit has been suggested as a ""proactive"" alternative to the ""reactive"" approach of RRS. This method ensures every patient is in an appropriate and safe environment from the moment of first contact with the hospital. Further research is needed into what interventions are most effective in preventing the deterioration and/or resuscitating seriously ill patients. Although physicians expert in hospital care decrease the cost and length of hospitalization without compromising outcomes hospital care will continue to be both expensive and potentially dangerous.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Antiarrhythmic drugs: A reorientation in light of recent developments in the control of disorders of rhythm,"Numerous developments in our knowledge of arrhythmias during the past decade or so have had a major influence on antiarrhythmic drug therapy. It has become increasingly evident that arrhythmias merit treatment not only for the relief of symptoms, with improvement in quality of life, but also for the prolongation of survival by decreasing arrhythmic deaths. No longer can mere suppression of arrhythmias, symptomatic or asymptomatic, be equated with prolonged survival. We now know that antiarrhythmic drugs that act by blocking sodium channels can increase mortality and that the most important determinants of arrhythmia mortality are the degree and nature of ventricular dysfunction. To these considerations must be added the advances in nonpharmacologic approaches to controlling cardiac arrhythmias. There has been a shift to the use of implantable devices and of drugs with alternative modes of action, such as beta blockers and class III drugs (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone). However, the side-effect profiles of these 2 classes of compounds have led to the synthesis and characterization of agents that act simply by blocking greater than or equal to 1 membrane ion channels, The isolated block of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kr) has been associated with patent antifibrillatory activity in the atria, with a neutral (e.g., with dofetilide) or deleterious (with d-sotalol) effect on mortality in postinfarct survivors. Therefore, the focus now is on compounds that can block > 1 ion channel (e.g., tedisamil and azimilide). Azimilide is the first of the class III agents that blocks both components of the delayed rectifier potassium current. The drug's overall action is associated with a spectrum of electrophysiologic properties that hold promise in the control of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, with potential for improving survival in patients at risk for cardiac arrest.

In the first stage survivors were recovered on basal yeast extract agar (BYEA) plates and incubated at 18C (18C-resuscitation) for specified time intervals (0 to 48 h). In the second stage, the incubation temperature was increased to 37C and the survivors were incubated for an additional 24 h to promote colony development. Controls consisted of survivors which were directly incubated at 37C on BYEA for time intervals equivalent to the total times used in the two-stage incubation protocol. The ratio of colony-forming units obtained with and without (control) the 18C-resuscitation protocol was used to calculate recovery factors (RF). Depending on the applied dose, RFs ranged from ca. 2.5 (0.44 kGy) to 15-18 (0.76 kGy) following an optimal resuscitation time of 24-28 h. Irreparable damage, incurred by incubating survivors directly at 37C (37C-damage) for 10 min prior to their recovery using the two-stage protocol, was minimal regardless of dose; however, extending 37C-damage to 60 min decreased RFs by ca. two-thirds.

To investigate demographics, clinical patterns and outcomes of rapid response reviews in hospital, reviewing indications for and outcomes of rapid response reviews initiated for clinical concern and to understand the role of clinical concern in identifying the deteriorating patient and at-risk patient populations. Method. This was a retrospective analysis of General Medical inpatients at Alfred Hospital from 1 January 2018 to 31 July 2020. Data extraction from electronic medical records identified patients who had a rapid response review during admission. Demographic and clinical data, investigations and clinical outcomes from rapid response reviews were investigated. Comparisons were performed using chi(2) or Fisher's exact test where appropriate. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for factors associated with rapid response reviews for clinical concern and clinical outcomes. Results. There were 10 797 admissions of 7409 individual patients. There were 2359 rapid response reviews during the study period, occurring in 13% of admissions. Patients were majority female (50.4%), and the median age was 79 +/- 17.6 years. Rapid response reviews were for cardiovascular (46.8%), respiratory (25.3%) and neurological (14.3%) indications. A total of 11% of rapid response reviews (n = 258) were for clinical concern. Inpatient falls accounted for a significant proportion of rapid response reviews for clinical concern. Reviews were more common in older patients, those admitted after-hours, and patients with disabilities. The latter group were more likely to have rapid response reviews for clinical concern. Rapid response reviews initiated for clinical concern were more likely than those initiated for standard criteria to change patients' clinical status, particularly the withdrawal of active management.Conclusions. Rapid response reviews for clinical concern are important triggers to identify clinical deterioration in vulnerable patients. Reviews were initiated for clinical concern were more likely than those initiated for standard criteria to result in a change in patients' resuscitation status and care trajectory.

It is increasingly recognised that deresuscitation is an essential part of fluid therapy and delayed deresuscitation is associated with longer invasive ventilation and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. However, optimal timing and rate of deresuscitation remain unclear. Lung ultrasound (LUS) may be used to identify fluid overload. We hypothesise that daily LUS-guided deresuscitation is superior to deresuscitation without LUS in critically ill patients expected to undergo invasive ventilation for more than 24 h in terms of ventilator free-days and being alive at day 28.MethodsThe ""effect of lung ultrasound-guided fluid deresuscitation on duration of ventilation in intensive care unit patients"" (CONFIDENCE) is a national, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) in adult critically ill patients that are expected to be invasively ventilated for at least 24 h.

After hemodynamic stabilisation, patients assigned to the intervention will receive daily LUS with fluid balance recommendations. Subjects in the control arm are deresuscitated at the physician's discretion without the use of LUS. The primary endpoint is the number of ventilator-free days and being alive at day 28. Secondary endpoints include the duration of invasive ventilation; 28-day mortality; 90-day mortality; ICU, in hospital and total length of stay; cumulative fluid balance on days 1-7 after randomisation and on days 1-7 after start of LUS examination; mean serum lactate on days 1-7; the incidence of reintubations, chest drain placement, atrial fibrillation, kidney injury (KDIGO stadium >= 2) and hypernatremia; the use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring, and chest-X-ray; and quality of life at day 28.DiscussionThe CONFIDENCE trial is the first RCT comparing the effect of LUS-guided deresuscitation to routine care in invasively ventilated ICU patients.

In addition, best practices for evaluation and management of developmental delays and disorders in this high-risk patient population have been formulated based on literature review and expert consensus. This American Heart Association scientific statement serves as an update to the 2012 statement on the evaluation and management of neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with congenital heart disease. It includes revised risk categories for developmental delay or disorder and an updated list of factors that increase neurodevelopmental risk in individuals with congenital heart disease according to current evidence, including genetic predisposition, fetal and perinatal factors, surgical and perioperative factors, socioeconomic disadvantage, and parental psychological distress. It also includes an updated algorithm for referral, evaluation, and management of individuals at high risk. Risk stratification of individuals with congenital heart disease with the updated categories and risk factors will identify a large and growing population of survivors at high risk for developmental delay or disorder and associated impacts across the life span. Critical next steps must include efforts to prevent and mitigate developmental delays and disorders. The goal of this scientific statement is to inform health care professionals caring for patients with congenital heart disease and other key stakeholders about the current state of knowledge of neurodevelopmental outcomes for individuals with congenital heart disease and best practices for neuroprotection, risk stratification, evaluation, and management.",CIRCULATION,2024,"Sood, E; Newburger, JW; Anixt, JS; Cassidy, AR; Jackson, JL; Jonas, RA; Lisanti, AJ; Lopez, KN; Peyvandi, S; Marino, BS",10.1161/CIR.0000000000001211,,WOS:001233249800002,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Longitudinal analysis of serum intestinal fatty acid-binding protein in a patient with non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia following brachial plexus block-induced hypotension: a case study,"Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) is a promising biomarker for small-bowel ischemia including non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI). A 75-year-old woman with diabetic nephropathy sustained a distal radius fracture. Two days later, she underwent a brachial plexus block to facilitate orthopedic surgery, which resulted in hypotension. Despite prompt fluid resuscitation and ephedrine administration, the patient developed abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed hepatic portal venous gas, but no direct evidence of small-bowel ischemia. The gastrointestinal surgery team opted for cautious in-hospital observation overnight. Unfortunately, the patient's condition significantly worsened the following day, prompting an urgent laparotomy. Surgery confirmed ileal segment necrosis, macroscopically characterized by a distinctive geographic pattern. Retrospective analysis of stored serum samples using a human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that I-FABP levels were moderately elevated (7.2 ng/mL) at the initial outpatient visit for the fracture, peaked (17.9 ng/mL) at the clinical onset of NOMI, and returned to normal (0.7 ng/mL) by postoperative day 2. Serum I-FABP levels correlated with the progression of NOMI, showing potential as an early detection marker. However, the longitudinal analysis of serum I-FABP also highlighted significant challenges of this biomarker, including the influence of renal function and the importance of sampling timing.",CLINICAL JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY,2025,"Kanda, T; Kawachi, Y; Kitami, C; Funaoka, H; Iwafuchi, Y",10.1007/s12328-024-02081-z,,WOS:001378169600001,A

Medical decision-making in this context raises ethical and legal questions, including considerations of sanctity of life versus quality of life and challenges in the clinician-parent relationship. This article outlines the complex ethical and legal landscape surrounding parental medical decision-making for periviable infants in the United States, discussing the evolution of federal and state laws. Existing laws highlight a vitalist approach that prioritizes life preservation despite potential harm and overlook non-heteronormative and non-traditional family structures, complicating decision-making. The impact of post-Dobbs state abortion bans on parental and clinician autonomy have exacerbated these challenges. We advocate for legislative support for inclusive definitions of legal parenthood to facilitate evidence-based decision-making centered on patients and families. Also needed are legal frameworks that accommodate the intricacies of periviable birth decisions while respecting patient autonomy and medical expertise, especially amidst the evolving legislative environment.",JOURNAL OF LAW MEDICINE & ETHICS,2025,"Tobin-Tyler, E; Edmonds, BT; Cheng, ER",10.1017/jme.2025.10186,,WOS:001640554500001,A

When acrania is not present, mortality remains high and morbidity for survivors is extreme. PATIENT: We describe is a term newborn with in-utero diagnosed rachischisis totalis without acrania and Chiari II malformation with subsequent hydrocephalus. RESULTS: At birth, clinical examination revealed rachischisis totalis without acrania. The spinal defect extended from the mid-cervical to the lower sacral vertebrae. Serial cranial ultrasonography and brain MRI revealed Chiari II malformation with severe hydrocephalus. The spinal defect was closed and a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placed to relieve the hydrocephalus. The clinical course was complicated by significant central apnea, often necessitating aggressive resuscitation and chest compressions. The infant has survived with expected severe developmental delay but has graduated from hospice care. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates that survival with variable function and quality of life is possible with severe open neural tube defects.

There has been a debate among both professionals and parents about whether it is appropriate to provide life-sustaining interventions to babies with these serious conditions. On one side of the debate are those who argue that there is no point in providing invasive, painful, and expensive procedures when the only outcomes are either early death or survival with severe cognitive impairment. Others suggest that, although mortality is high and cognitive impairment universal, babies with these conditions have an acceptable quality of life. In this paper, we will discuss both points of view. We will review the ways in which these conditions are portrayed in pediatrics textbooks and on social media sites that offer support to parents.

Experimental and clinical studies of septic shock support the concept that early resuscitation with fluid and inotropic therapies improves survival in a time-dependent manner. The new American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support (ACCM-PALS) Guidelines for hemodynamic support of newborns and children in septic shock recommend this therapeutic approach. The objective of this study was to determine whether early septic shock reversal and use of resuscitation practice consistent with the new ACCM-PALS Guidelines by community physicians is associated with improved outcome.,PEDIATRICS,2003,"Han, YY; Carcillo, JA; Dragotta, MA; Bills, DM; Watson, RS; Westerman, ME; Orr, RA",10.1542/peds.112.4.793,,WOS:000185665700019,A

Intermittent EEG was used for the diagnosis of SE according to clinical practice. Two raters blinded to outcome analyzed EEGs retrospectively for possible and definitive SE patterns and background features (frequency, continuity, reactivity, and voltage). Definitive SE was classified according to semiology (ILAE). Mortality and Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) score were evaluated 1 month after CA.Results: We included 64 patients of whom 92% died. Among the survivors, only one patient had a good neurological outcome (CPC 1). No patient survived with a burst suppression pattern, low voltage, or electro-cerebral silence in any EEG. Possible or definitive SE was diagnosed in a median of 47 h (IQR 39-72 h) after CA. EEG criteria for definitive electrographic SE were fulfilled in 39% of patients; in 38% - for electroclinical SE and in 23% - for ictal-interictal continuum (IIC). The outcome did not differ significantly between the three groups. The only patient with good functional outcome belonged to the IIC group. Comatose non-convulsive SE (NCSE) without subtle motor phenomenon occurred in 20% of patients with definitive electrographic SE and outcome was similar to other types of SE.Significance: Possible or definitive SE due to hypoxic brain injury is associated with poor prognosis.

Outcome was similar in patients with definitive electrographic SE with and without prominent motor features.",EPILEPTIC DISORDERS,2023,"Orav, K; Varela, PB; Pruewasser, T; Machegger, L; Leitinger, M; Trinka, E; Kuchukhidze, G",10.1002/epd2.20164,,WOS:001083370300001,A
wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,JOUR,Transcutaneous pressure of oxygen: A noninvasive and early detector of peripheral shock and outcome,"A noninvasive tool to recognize early shock would improve outcome by providing prompt recognition of tissue ischemia and precise resuscitation endpoint. The skin is the first tissue bed to vasoconstrict in shock states. Studies have demonstrated that transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (PtCO2) increases with higher FiO(2) in nonshock states as arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) increases, but in shock situations, PtCO2 mirrors changes in cardiac output and oxygen delivery with minimum response to increasing FiO(2) and PaO2. This study examined the relationship of hemodynamic variables and the degree of PtCO2 response to FiO(2) Of 1.0 (identified as the ""oxygen challenge test"") to mortality and organ failure. This prospective observational study examined 38 patients requiring at least 24 h of cardiac output monitoring for shock resuscitation in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit. Patients were resuscitated to the standard protocol of blood pressure, urine output, oxygen delivery (DO2), and mixed venous O-2 (SVO2). Seventy-nine percent of the patients (30/38) with a mean age of 59 21 years had septic shock or severe sepsis with a 26% mortality (10/38). Measurements included hemodynamic variables, PtCO2, and outcome (mortality and organ failure). In this study, the ability of PtCO2 value to increase by 21 mmHg on a FiO(2) Of 1.0, at 24 h of resuscitation, divided survivors from nonsurvivors, P < .001.

wos,WoS-queryA3.ris,CPAPER,Suppression of Autonomic Drive Determined by Nonlinear HRV analysis in Therapeutic Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest,"Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended as a cardiac arrest treatment for neuroprotection. In this study, we aimed to explore nonlinear heart rate variability (HRV) with other domains to clearify and setting up the significant index for survival. All patients were divided into two groups by 7 days survival outcome (n = 9 vs. 9). The limb lead II ECG signals are collected (10 minutes, sampling rate: 1000 Hz) for all phases; 6, 18 hours after induction (A and B), during rewarming (C) and recover (D). Fluctuation of heart rate (HR) was presented in both groups especially in C and D phases. Standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) was significantly decreased from phase A to C in survivors (p< 0.05). Abrupt increase in SDNN was observed in non survivors and caused a significant difference compared to survivors in C phase. During A-C, low-frequency to high-frequency power ratio (LF/HF) and SD2 of Poincare's plot were suppressed in survivors and they slightly increased in D phases. Less suppression of those LF/HF ratio and SD2 was evident in non survivors. Gradual increase in sample entropy (SampEn) was consistent with prolong suppression of LF/HF ratio and SD2 in survivors. Significant difference of SampEN in both groups was presented at C phase. Prominent SampEn at rewarm of survivors was consistent with large and more scatter signals in Poincare's plot that may explain the rebound response after autonomic suppression. Contrast to survivors, less and ineffective autonomic suppression from hypothermia lead to a crisis in rewarming phase. Also, we notice significant difference of SDNN, SD2 and SampEN in non survivors. In conclusion, nonlinear HRV with SDNN and LF/HF ratio are able to determine successful, effective and rebound responses of hypothermia through autonomic suppression during A-C periods even though HR of both groups is displayed in C and D periods.",6TH BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE (BMEICON 2013),2013,"Jantanukul, A; Muengtaweepongsa, S; Suwanprasert, K",,,WOS:000330478200023,A

We aimed to elucidate these differences using large-scale nationwide data. Methods This prospective cohort study analyzed data from the Korean Sepsis Alliance registry, comprising 21 intensive care units (ICUs) across 20 hospitals from September 2019 to December 2021. Patients meeting the Sepsis-3 criteria were included. Results Among 11,981 sepsis patients, 3501 were analyzed, all of whom were referred to the ICU through the emergency department (mean age: 72 +/- 13 years; 1976 [56%] males). Of these, 2213 (63%) were culture-positive sepsis and 1288 (37%) were culture-negative sepsis. Compared to the culture-positive sepsis group, the culture-negative sepsis group exhibited less severe illness, with lower Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores and less deteriorated vital signs. While pulmonary-origin sepsis was common in both groups, culture-negative patients primarily presented with pulmonary infections and had a higher incidence of respiratory failure. In comparison to the culture-positive sepsis group, blood cultures and the administration of empirical antibiotics were performed less promptly in the culture-negative sepsis group. Patients with culture-negative sepsis also showed lower compliance with fluid resuscitation (98.4% vs. 96.9%, p = 0.038; culture-positive sepsis vs. culture-negative sepsis) and received vasopressors earlier (31.1% vs. 35.9%, p = 0.012). In-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups (31.6% vs. 34.9%, p = 0.073); however, in patients with septic shock, culture-negative sepsis had higher mortality rates (37.6% vs. 45.1%, p = 0.029). The apparent appropriateness of empirical antibiotics in the culture-negative septic shock was higher than that of the culture-positive septic shock (85.2% vs. 96.8%, p < 0.001). Culture-negativity independently predicted poor prognosis in septic shock patients (OR: 1.462, 95% CI [1.060-2.017], p = 0.021). Conclusion In patients with septic shock, culture-negativity was associated with increased mortality, despite the paradoxically higher appropriateness of empirical antibiotics than culture-positive patients. These contradictory findings suggest that the current criteria for determining the appropriateness of empirical antibiotic therapy may not be valid for culture-negative sepsis.",CRITICAL CARE,2024,"Chang, YJ; Oh, JH; Oh, DK; Lee, SY; Hyun, DG; Park, MH; Lim, CM",10.1186/s13054-024-05151-3,,WOS:001363527900003,A

In the military setting, thoracic trauma was reported as a significant cause of death. With well-timed treatment, chest trauma is regarded as survivable. Emergency thoracotomy (ET) is considered when the patient with trauma to the chest needs immediate resuscitation. Survival rate is reported as low as 1% in some reports and 20% in others. The survival rate depends on injury mechanism, protocols for intervention, and other decompressive procedures.Objectives: To determine parameters that may impact survival of ET.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare prehospital and in-hospital data regarding ET in the emergency department (ED) versus the operating room (OR).Results: Between 2009 and 2017, 6532 casualties presented to the ED; 1125 with trauma to the chest. Fifty-four of those with chest trauma underwent ET in the hospital (4.8%), 22 (41%) in the ED, and 32 (59%) in the OR. The overall mortality of the ET subgroup was 48%. With regard to thoracotomies, 19/22 of patients (86%) who underwent ET in the ED died compared to 2/28 in the OR (13%).Conclusions: Utilizing ET after chest trauma with appropriate clinical indications, well-trained personnel, and prompt transportation poses a significant challenge, but may be associated with better survival than that reported previously with military casualties.

To evaluate current vitrification works, we investigated the critical pathway alternations in vitrified-warmed juvenile 10-day-old mouse ovary. We showed a significant decrease of protein kinase B (Akt) and Mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mapk) phosphorylation, during which serine/threonine kinases play central roles in coordinating follicle and oocyte development and stress response. Inhibition of Akt and Mapk activity were associated with one of the imprinted insulin pathway negative regulatory genes, Growth factor receptor-binding protein 10 (Grb10) which remarkably increased in vitrified-warmed juvenile mouse ovary than that of fresh group (p < 0.05). RNAi-induced Grb10 down-regulation reversed the decrease in Akt and Mapk phosphorylation. The increase of GrblO expression was partially caused by the hyper-methylation of the promoter region, associated with the decrease of follicular DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 1 protein in different stages of vitrified-warmed group, compared to fresh group (p < 0.05). The mRNA and protein expression of Dnmt1 in ovary of vitrified-warmed juvenile mouse were remarkably lower than those in fresh group (p < 0.05). Dnmtl overexpression dramatically reversed GrblO up regulation and Akt and Mapk phosphorylation reduction. Taken together, our findings suggest that GrblO expression might be helpful in evaluation of effectiveness of vitrification, and considered as a potential target for further vitrification protocols improvement in the future.",CRYOBIOLOGY,2018,"He, ZY; Wang, HY; Zhou, X; Liang, XY; Yan, B; Wang, R; Ma, LH; Wang, YL",10.1016/j.cryobiol.2017.11.008,,WOS:000425485100014,A
