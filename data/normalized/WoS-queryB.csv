wos,WoS-queryB.ris,JOUR,Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Severe Abdominal Trauma: A Secondary Analysis of the Damage Control Laparotomy Trial,"Introduction: Little is known about patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following abdominal trauma. We hypothesized that patients undergoing definitive laparotomy (DEF) would have better PROs compared to those treated with damage control laparotomy (DCL). Methods: The DCL Trial randomized DEF versus DCL in abdominal trauma. PROs were measured using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D) questionnaire at discharge and six months postdischarge (1 = perfect health, 0 = death, and <0 = worse than death) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Civilian. Unadjusted Bayesian analysis with a neutral prior was used to assess the posterior probability of achieving minimal clinically important difference. Results: Of 39 randomized patients (21 DEF versus 18 DCL), 8 patients died (7 DEF versus 1 DCL). Of those who survived, 28 completed the EQ-5D at discharge (12 DEF versus 16 DCL) and 25 at 6 mo (12 DEF versus 13 DCL). Most patients were male (79%) with a median age of 30 (interquartile range (IQR) 21-42), suffered blunt injury (56%), and were severely injured (median injury severity score 33, IQR 21 - 42). Median EQ-5D value at discharge was 0.20 (IQR 0.06 - 0.52) DEF versus 0.31 (IQR -0.03 - 0.43) DCL, and at six months 0.51 (IQR 0.30 0.74) DEF versus 0.50 (IQR 0.28 - 0.84) DCL.

wos,WoS-queryB.ris,JOUR,"Is frailty associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest? - A Swedish cohort study","Background: Frailty is associated with poor 30-days survival after in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA). The aim was to assess how pre-arrest frailty was associated with long-term survival, neurological function and patient-reported outcomes in elderly survivors after IHCA.Methods: Patients aged >= 65 years with IHCA at Karolinska University Hospital between 2013-2021 were studied. Frailty was assessed by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) based on clinical records and categorised into non-frail (1-4) or frail (5-7). Survival was assessed in days. Neurological function was assessed by the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC). A telephone interview was performed six months post-IHCA and included the questionnaires EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.Results: Totally, 232 (28%) out of 817 eligible patients survived to 30-days. Out of 232, 65 (28%) were frail. Long-term survival was better for non-frail than frail patients (6 months (92% versus 75%, p-value < 0.01), 3 years (74% vs 22%, p-value < 0.01)). The vast majority of both non-frail and frail patients had unchanged CPC from admittance to discharge from hospital (87% and 85%, respectively, p-value 0.52). The 121 non-frail patients reported better health compared to 27 frail patients (EQ-VAS median 70 versus 50 points, p-value < 0.01) and less symptoms of depression than frail (16% and 52%, respectively, p-value < 0.01).Conclusion: Frail patients suffering IHCA survived with the same neurological function they had at admittance. Although one in five frail patients survived to three years, frailty was associated with a marked decrease in long-term survival as well as increased symptoms of depression and poorer general health.",RESUSCITATION,2022,"Jonsson, H; Piscator, E; Israelsson, J; Lilja, G; Djaerv, T",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2022.07.013,,WOS:000880404500011,B

wos,WoS-queryB.ris,JOUR,How do survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest perceive their health compared to the norm population? A nationwide registry study from Norway,"Introduction: Self-perceived health status data is usually collected using patient-reported outcome measures. Information from the patients' perspective is one of the important components in planning person-centred care. The study aimed to compare EQ-5D-5L in survivors after out -ofhospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with data for Norwegian population controls. Secondary aim included comparing characteristics of respondents and non-respondents from the OHCA population. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, 714 OHCA survivors received an electronic EQ-5D-5L questionnaire 3-6 months following OHCA. EQ-5D5L assesses for five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with five-point descriptive scales and overall health on a visual analogue scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) (EQ VAS). Results are used to calculate the EQ index ranging from -0.59 (worst) to 1 (best). Patient responses were matched for age and sex with existing data from controls, collected through a postal survey (response rate 26%), and compared with Chi-square tests or t-tests as appropriate. Results: Of 784 OHCA survivors, 714 received the EQ-5D-5L, and 445 (62%) responded. Respondents had higher rates of shockable first rhythm and better cerebral performance category scores than the non-respondents. OHCA survivors reported poorer health compared to controls as assessed by EQ-5D-5L dimensions, the EQ index (0.76 +/- 0.24 vs 0.82 +/- 0.18), and EQ VAS (69 +/- 21 vs 79 +/- 17), except for the pain/discomfort dimension.

wos,WoS-queryB.ris,JOUR,Determinants of health-related quality of life after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA): A systematic review,"Objective: With a growing number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors globally, the focus of OHCA management has now broadened to survivorship. An outcome central to survivorship is health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related to the determinants of HRQoL of OHCA survivors.Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus from inception to 15 August 2022 to identify studies investigating the asso-ciation of at least one determinant and HRQoL in adult OHCA survivors. All articles were independently reviewed by two investigators. We abstracted data pertaining to determinants and classified them using a well-established HRQoL theoretical framework - the Wilson and Cleary (re-vised) model.Results: 31 articles assessing a total of 35 determinants were included. Determinants were classified into the five domains in the HRQoL model. 26 studies assessed determinants related to individual characteristics (n = 3), 12 studied biological function (n = 7), nine studied symptoms (n = 3), 16 studied functioning (n = 5), and 35 studied characteristics of the environment (n = 17). In studies that included multivariable analyses, most reported that individual characteristics (older age, female sex), symptoms (anxiety, depression), and functioning (impaired neurocognitive function) were sig-nificantly associated with poorer HRQoL.Conclusions: Individual characteristics, symptoms, and functioning played significant roles in explaining the variability in HRQoL. Significant non-modifiable determinants such as age and sex could be used to identify populations at risk of poorer HRQoL, while significant modifiable determinants such as psychological health and neurocognitive functioning could serve as targets for post-discharge screening and rehabilitation plans.",RESUSCITATION,2023,"Pek, PP; Fan, KC; Ong, MEH; Luo, N; Ostbye, T; Lim, SL; Ho, AF",10.1016/j.resuscitation.2023.109794,,WOS:001001962600001,B
wos,WoS-queryB.ris,JOUR,COSCA (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest) in Adults: An Advisory Statement From the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation,"Cardiac arrest effectiveness trials have traditionally reported outcomes that focus on survival. A lack of consistency in outcome reporting between trials limits the opportunities to pool results for meta-analysis. The COSCA initiative (Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest), a partnership between patients, their partners, clinicians, research scientists, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, sought to develop a consensus core outcome set for cardiac arrest for effectiveness trials. Core outcome sets are primarily intended for large, randomised clinical effectiveness trials (sometimes referred to as pragmatic trials or phase III/IV trials) rather than for pilot or efficacy studies. A systematic review of the literature combined with qualitative interviews among cardiac arrest survivors was used to generate a list of potential outcome domains. This list was prioritised through a Delphi process, which involved clinicians, patients, and their relatives/partners. An international advisory panel narrowed these down to 3 core domains by debate that led to consensus. The writing group refined recommendations for when these outcomes should be measured and further characterised relevant measurement tools. Consensus emerged that a core outcome set for reporting on effectiveness studies of cardiac arrest (COSCA) in adults should include survival, neurological function, and health-related quality of life. This should be reported as survival status and modified Rankin scale score at hospital discharge, at 30 days, or both. Health-related quality of life should be measured with >= 1 tools from Health Utilities Index version 3, Short-Form 36-Item Health Survey, and EuroQol 5D-5L at 90 days and at periodic intervals up to 1 year after cardiac arrest, if resources allow.

The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Methods: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. Results: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months. At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5). Discussion: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Post-hoc analyses of the international multicentre Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial. At 6 months, survivors at 61 sites in Europe, Australia and New Zeeland were invited to a follow-up. The participants answered two questions on self-reported physical activity. Answers were categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of physical activity and further dichotomized into a low versus moderate/high level of physical activity.

Methods: We included survivors from the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after OHCA (TTM2) trial, who completed EQ-5D-5L at 6 months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate the hypothesised unidimensional latent structure of EQ level sum score (EQ LSS), summarizing scores across Mobility, Self-care, Usual activities, Pain/discomfort, and Anxiety/depression. Differential item functioning was evaluated for age. We examined internal consistency and precision for the EQ LSS. We evaluated construct validity of EQ LSS, EQ value and EQ VAS, using the modified Rankin Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, representing functional outcome and cognitive function-two common health challenges experienced by OHCA survivors. Results: 783 of 939 (84%) eligible survivors were included. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good model fit and strong factor loadings for all dimensions (0.61-0.90). We observed a significant but negligible effect of age on Mobility (b = 0.29, p < 0.001, Delta R-2 = 0.019). Internal consistency was 0.88. The floor effect was 35%. Survivors with more functional dependency and/or cognitive problems reported significantly worse health by EQ LSS, EQ value, and EQ VAS (all, p < 0.001).

Results: Demographic comparison revealed significant differences in racial demographics and disability status between the EACPP and OCPP groups. There was no significant difference in EHP-30, PROMIS Global Physical, or Global Mental scores between the two groups.

Mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups. In addition to survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a key outcome parameter for OHCA patients.Methods and results The analysis included 169 survivors from the TOMAHAWK trial who completed both the 6-month and 12-month follow-up (6M-FU/12M-FU). HRQoL was assessed using a questionnaire based on the EuroQoL-5D-3L. This tool includes a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 (worst to best imaginable subjective health) and a descriptive system with five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. No relevant differences were found between patients in the immediate angiography group and those in the delayed/selective angiography group regarding EQ-VAS scores at 6M-FU (70 +/- 21 vs. 74 +/- 18) and 12M-FU (72 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 17).

Although clinical guidelines recommend structured post-cardiac arrest follow-up, such follow-up is often lacking or inconsistent. Tailored digital interventions are scarce but may help address gaps in follow-up resources. The CARDIS trial evaluates the effects on patient-reported outcome measures of a co-created, web-based support programme designed to improve wellbeing, self management, and reintegration into everyday life for cardiac arrest survivors. Methods: CARDIS is a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial enrolling cardiac arrest survivors aged >18 years. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control. Both groups will receive standard post-cardiac arrest care, including a routine followup visit with screening and management of cognitive, physical and emotional health, as well as a printed booklet. The intervention group will additionally receive access to a webbased selfguided support programme for 3 months. After study completion, control participants will be offered the programme. Outcomes: Primary outcome is overall wellbeing and health (QWB) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include self-reported cognitive problems, HRQoL, life satisfaction, symptoms of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. A process evaluation will evaluate social selection bias, adherence and participants experiences. Discussion: The CARDIS trial will investigate the use of more accessible and standardised follow-up pathways by complementing existing care structures, thereby enhancing equity in long-term recovery and quality-of-life without requiring additional healthcare resources.

Methods: We present data from survivors aged 18-50 years registered with OHCA in the Norwegian Cardiac Arrest Registry between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017. Survivors were invited to answer two questionnaires; (1) the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Version 1, and (2) about exercise habits prior to OHCA. Respondents were randomly matched 1:1 for age and sex with a reference population (data were available from the Norwegian Centre for Research Data). Results: Of the 175 survivors invited, 95 (54%) responded, median age was 44 (range 35-48) years, 26 (27%) females. Valid results for SF-36 were available for 91 survivors, of whom 87 reported pre-OHCA exercise-volume. Prior to OHCA, 21 did no regular exercise, 44 exercised 1-4 hours/week and 22 exercised >5 hours/week. Compared to the reference population survivors had significantly (p < 0.01) poorer SF-36 scores for scales relating to physical-and mental health. SF-36 scale scores were similar in survivors who did and did not exercise regularly. Within the regular exercisers, survivors reporting >5 hours of exercise/week had better SF-36 scores than those exercising less.

Convergent validity was evaluated by correlating ECR-RS total scores with HADS and SF-12 MCS. Results: Among 123 survivors (median age 59.9 years, 84 % male), ECR-RS total scores were low on both subscales and floor effects were observed at scale level (31 % for avoidant and 72 % for anxious attachment). EFA supported the expected two-factor structure, though item 4-6 showed poor loadings/cross-loadings. Internal consistency was acceptable (total scale Cronbach's a = 0.88) and improved when problematic items were excluded. Known-group hypotheses were not supported. Anxious attachment correlated moderately with symptoms of anxiety and depression and was inversely correlated with mental health scores. Conclusion: The ECR-RS demonstrated partial construct validity among OHCA survivors, but item-level inconsistencies and pronounced floor effects limit its utility.

Methods This is a cohort-based secondary analysis of the Targeted Hypothermia versus Targeted Normothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (TTM2) trial, an international, prospective, multicentre study. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (1-9): fit (1-3), prefrail (4), frail (5), and severely frail (6-9). Main outcomes were mortality and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) at 6 and 24 months. Additional outcomes included neuroprognostication, withdrawal-of-life-sustaining-therapies (WLST), functional decline (retrospectively reported pre-arrest versus 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score), health status (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), and life satisfaction at 6 and 24 months. Results Of 1861 participants, 240 (13%) were prefrail, and 188 (10%) were frail or severely frail. Mortality and poor functional outcome increased significantly with greater frailty. Compared to fit participants, adjusted ORs (95% CI) for 6 month mortality were: prefrail 2.7 (1.8-3.8), frail 3.7 (1.9-7.1), and severely frail 8.9 (4.2-18.7); and poor functional outcome: prefrail 2.9 (1.9-4.2), frail 3.9 (1.9-8.1), and severely frail 35.4 (8.4-148.8). Severely frail participants underwent neuroprognostication less often (p < 0.001), while WLST was more common in the prefrail, frail and severely frail (p < 0.001). Prefrail and frail survivors tended to report more frequent functional decline and lower health status, though with individual variation. Conclusion Frailty was associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality and poor functional outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Detailed knowledge of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term cognitive function is limited. HRQoL and cognitive function were assessed in ECPR-survivors and OHCA-survivors with prehospital return of spontaneous circulation after standard advanced cardiac life support Methods: Fifteen ECPR-survivors and 22 age-matched sACLS-survivors agreed to participate in this follow-up study. Participants were examined with echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and neuropsychological testing, and answered HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L and Short Form 36 (SF-36)), and Results: Most patients were male (73 % and 82 %) and median age at follow-up was similar between groups (55 years and 60 years).

Methods and Settings: A retrospective cohort study using the Australian and New Zealand extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EXCEL) registry for ECPR cases and the Victorian Ambulance Cardiac Arrest Registry (VACAR) for CCPR cases. All the adult patients with OHCA who had their cardiac arrest and 12-month HRQoL data recorded between July 2019 and July 2023 were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcomes were the 12month EuroQol five-dimension (EQ-5D-5L) utility score and EuroQol visual analogue score (EQ-VAS). Results: There were 33/122(28%) ECPR and 1,074/8,990(12%) CCPR OHCA survivors at 12 months. Of these, 24 (73%) ECPR and 754 (70%) CCPR survivors had HRQoL data.

This study aimed to evaluate long-term neurologically intact survival, functional capacity and quality of life after refractory OHCA treated with MCS.Methods: This was a follow-up study of survivors after refractory OHCA treated with MCS. Follow-up examinations comprised clinical assessment with transthoracic echocardiography and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX). Neurological and cognitive screening was evaluated with the Cere -bral Performance Category (CPC) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test). A good neurological outcome was defined as CPC 1 or CPC 2. Health-related quality of life was measured by questionnaires (Short Form-36 (SF-36)).Results: A total of 101 patients with refractory OHCA were treated with MCS at Aarhus University Hospital between 2015 and 2019. The total low-flow time was median 105 min [IQR, 94-123] minutes. The hospital discharge rate was 27%. At a mean follow-up time of 4.8 years +/- 1.6 (range 2.8- 6.1 years), 21 patients remained alive of whom 15 consented to participate in the present study. Good neurological outcome with CPC 1-2 was found in 93% (14/15) patients. No severe cognitive function was discovered; mean MoCA score of 26.4 +/- 3.1.

It is unknown how HRQoL evolves over time, and assessments at different time points may lead to different results. Methods: In a NORCAST sub study, OHCA survivors eligible for health status (EQ-5D-3L) and HRQoL (SF-36) assessments were examinated six months and five years after OHCA. At five-year follow-up, survivors also retrospectively assessed their health status for each consecutive year fol-lowing OHCA.

Health status and HRQoL remained stable over time, except for increasing SF-36 mental summary score and decreasing physical functioning and physical component score. Anxiety and depression levels were generally low, although younger survivors stated more anxiety than older survivors. Retrospective assessment showed reduced health status for the first two years, which increased only from the third year. Explorative analyses revealed that younger age, long-er time to return of spontaneous circulation (tROSC) and late awakening affected health status, particularly in the first two years post-arrest.

The survey was conducted from October 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.Exposure All patients who experienced an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.Main Outcome and Measures Self-reported health was measured using the EuroQol Health Questionnaire index (EQ index) score and EQ visual analog scale. Physical and mental health were measured using the SF-12, and anxiety and depression were measured using the HADS. Descriptive statistics were used for the analysis.Results Of 4545 survivors, 2552 (56.1%) completed the survey, with a median follow-up since their event of 5.5 years (IQR, 2.9-8.9 years). Age was comparable between responders and nonresponders (median [IQR], 67 [58-74] years vs 68 [56-78] years), and 2075 responders (81.3%) were men and 477 (18.7%) women (vs 1473 male [73.9%] and 520 female [26.1%] nonresponders). For the shortest follow-up (0-1 year) and longest follow-up (>15-20 years) groups, the median EQ index score was 0.9 (IQR, 0.7-1.0) and 0.9 (0.8-1.0), respectively. For all responders, the mean (SD) SF-12 physical health score was 43.3 (12.3) and SF-12 mental health score, 52.9 (8.3). All 3 scores were comparable to a general Danish reference population. Based on HADS scores, a low risk for anxiety was reported by 73.0% (54 of 74) of 0- to 1-year survivors vs 89.3% (100 of 112) of greater than 15- to 20-year survivors; for symptoms of depression, these proportions were 79.7% (n = 59) and 87.5% (n = 98), respectively.

Because of the impact of IHCA more data is needed on incidence, outcomes and associated factors that are present prior to cardiac arrest. The aim was to assess one-year survival, patient-centred outcomes after IHCA and their associated pre-arrest factors. Methods: A multicentre prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 1st 2017 and May 31st 2018. Patients > 18 years receiving car-diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for IHCA were included. Data were collected using Utstein and COSCA-criteria, supplemented by pre-arrest Mod-ified Rankin Scale (MRS, functional status) and morbidity through the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Main outcomes were survival, health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EuroQoL) and functional status (MRS) after one-year. Results: A total of 713 patients were included, 64.5% was male, median age was 63 years (IQR 52-72) and 72.8% had a non-shockable rhythm, 394 (55.3%) achieved ROSC, 231 (32.4%) survived to hospital discharge and 198 (27.8%) survived one year after cardiac arrest. Higher pre-arrest MRS, age and CCI were associated with mortality. At one year, patients rated HRQoL 72/100 points on the EQ-VAS and 69.7% was functionally independent. Conclusion: One-year survival after IHCA in this study is 27.8%, which is relatively high compared to previous studies.

wos,WoS-queryB.ris,JOUR,Health-related quality of life one year after refractory cardiac arrest treated with conventional or extracorporeal CPR; a secondary analysis of the INCEPTION-trial,"Background: Prospective, trial-based data comparing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) through extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) or conventional CPR (CCPR) are scarce. We aimed to determine HRQoL during 1-year after refractory OHCA in patients treated with ECPR and CCPR. Methods: We present a secondary analysis of the multicenter INCEPTION-trial, which studied the effectiveness of ECPR versus CCPR in patients with refractory OHCA. HRQoL was prospectively assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Poor HRQoL was pragmatically defined as an EQ-5D-5L health utility index (HUI) > 1 SD below the age-adjusted norm. We used mixed linear models to assess the difference in HRQoL over time and univariable analyses to assess factors potentially associated with poor HRQoL. Results: A total of 134 patients were enrolled, and hospital survival was 20% (27 patients). EQ-5D-5L data were available for 25 patients (5 ECPR and 20 CCPR). One year after OHCA, the estimated mean HUI was 0.73 (0.05) in all patients, 0.84 (0.12) in ECPR survivors, and 0.71 (0.05) in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.31). Eight (32%) survivors had a poor HRQoL. HRQoL was good in 17 (68%) patients, with 100% in ECPR survivors versus 60% in CCPR survivors (p-value 0.14). Conclusion: One year after refractory OHCA, 68% of the survivors had a good HRQoL. We found no statistically significant difference in HRQoL one year after OHCA in patients treated with ECPR compared to CCPR.

This study aimed to analyze PICS at 24 months follow-up, to identify potential risk factors for PICS, and to assess health-related quality of life in a long-term cohort of adult cardiac arrest survivors. This prospective cohort study included adult cardiac arrest survivors admitted to the intensive care unit of a Swiss tertiary academic medical center. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of PICS at 24 months follow-up, defined as impairments in physical (measured through the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions-3-Levels instrument [EQ-5D-3L]), neurological (defined as Cerebral Performance Category Score > 2 or Modified Rankin Score > 3), and psychological (based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised) domains. Among 107 cardiac arrest survivors that completed the 2-year follow-up, 46 patients (43.0%) had symptoms of PICS, with 41 patients (38.7%) experiencing symptoms in the physical domain, 16 patients (15.4%) in the psychological domain, and 3 patients (2.8%) in the neurological domain. Key predictors for PICS in multivariate analyses were female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.08 to 9.3), duration of no-flow interval during cardiac arrest (minutes) (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33), post-discharge job-loss (aOR 31.25, 95% CI 3.63 to 268.83), need for ongoing psychological support (aOR 3.64, 95% CI 1.29 to 10.29) or psychopharmacologic treatment (aOR 9.49, 95% CI 1.9 to 47.3), and EQ-visual analogue scale (points) (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.93). More than one-third of cardiac arrest survivors experience symptoms of PICS 2 years after resuscitation, with the highest impairment observed in the physical and psychological domains.
